## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive overview of 15 Crux Facebook posts reviewed for compliance with New Zealand Media Council (NZMC) standards during the 2025 Queenstown Lakes District Council election period.

## Recommended Complaint Strategy

### Option A: Single Comprehensive Complaint (All Principles)
**Select 3-4 strongest posts demonstrating pattern across all principles**

**Recommended Posts:**
1. **250920 - John Glover** (P1, P4, P5, P6, P10)
2. **250913 - Wanaka Chamber** (P1, P4, P6, P10 - meta-conflict)
3. **250927 - Lisa Guy Conflict** (P1, P4, P10)

**Advantages:**
- Shows systematic pattern across multiple principles
- Demonstrates repeated breaches despite previous NZMC findings
- Concentrated in final 3 weeks of election (maximum impact)

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex complaint may be harder to adjudicate
- Risk of some breaches being dismissed while others upheld

---

### Option B: Separate Complaints by Principle (Recommended)
**File 4 separate complaints, each focused on one principle with 3-4 strongest examples**

#### Complaint 1: P1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance)
**Focus:** No right of reply during election period

**Recommended Posts:**
1. **250920** - John Glover (unverified legal claims, 21 days before election)
2. **250922** - Lisa Guy CEO (stenography, no verification, 19 days before election)
3. **250927** - Lisa Guy Conflict (serious allegations, 14 days before election)
4. **250916** - Cheerleader (professional conduct questioned, no reply)

**Strength:** Clear pattern of denying right of reply, concentrated in election period

---

#### Complaint 2: P4 (Comment and Fact)
**Focus:** Opinion presented as fact, loaded framing

**Recommended Posts:**
1. **250916** - Cheerleader (loaded characterization as fact)
2. **250920** - John Glover (opinion/speculation as news)
3. **250922** - Lisa Guy CEO (stenography pattern)
4. **250927** - Lisa Guy Conflict ("undeclared conflict" as fact)

**Strength:** Clear examples of opinion as fact, previous NZMC findings on same issue

---

#### Complaint 3: P6 (Headlines)
**Focus:** Loaded language, speculation as certainty

**Recommended Posts:**
1. **250916** - Cheerleader (clearest example: "cheerleader" loaded term)
2. **250913** - Wanaka Chamber ("pro-Lewers" characterization)
3. **250920** - John Glover ("no mandate" speculation as fact)

**Strength:** Clear loaded language, previous NZMC findings on headlines

---

#### Complaint 4: P10 (Conflicts of Interest)
**Focus:** Electoral context undisclosed, meta-conflicts

1. **250913** - Wanaka Chamber (meta-conflict, Crux's own stake)

3. **250927** - Lisa Guy Conflict (advocacy source, 14 days before election)
4. **250928** - Lewers Timing (candidate letter as news, 13 days before election)

**Strength:** Clear pattern of undisclosed conflicts, meta-conflicts where Crux has stake

---

### Option C: Combined Articles + Facebook Posts Complaint
