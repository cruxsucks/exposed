## Executive Summary
This article reports on QLDC Councillor Lisa Guy's claim that she is "not a shareholder" of Rationale Ltd, when Companies Office records show she is listed as a shareholder. The article examines potential conflicts of interest related to a $30,000 council contract awarded to Rationale, a company in which Mrs Guy has documented shareholding interests. While the article raises legitimate public interest questions about conflicts of interest and voting restrictions, it demonstrates strong compliance with NZMC principles by providing extensive balance through multiple responses from both Mrs Guy and QLDC, clearly distinguishing between verified facts and opinion, and maintaining accuracy throughout. The article's investigation into shareholding claims and conflict of interest procedures is thoroughly documented with evidence from Companies Office records and the Office of the Auditor General.

## Article Summary
The article investigates QLDC Councillor Lisa Guy's Facebook claim that she is "personally not a shareholder of Rationale" following public questions about her role as a councillor while her husband's company receives council contracts. The article presents:

- Companies Office records showing Lisa Guy is listed as a shareholder in Rationale Ltd alongside her husband Edward Guy and their family trust EGLG Trustees Ltd (holding 74.8% of shares)
- Background on Rationale's millions of dollars in previous QLDC work on controversial projects (CBD upgrade, arterial road, Project Manawa)
- Mrs Guy's 2022 election claims about OAG approval and contract limits
- Discovery of a new $30,000 contract to Rationale approved by the OAG in November 2023
- Mrs Guy's Facebook post claiming "I personally am not a shareholder of Rationale"
- OAG's response emphasizing the contract approval "does not suspend the normal prohibition on Councillor Guy discussing or voting on matters in which she has a financial interest"
- QLDC's confirmation the contract relates to three waters review work
- Mrs Guy's full responses explaining she doesn't hold shares "in person" but as trustee of the Guy family trust
- Key issues regarding voting restrictions and conflict of interest management

The article provides extensive right of reply and presents documented evidence for all factual claims.

## Context Considerations
The ReviewContext.MD indicates Queenstown Lakes District Council local government elections are underway, and notes that Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council. The README.md file shows Crux has had 5 complaints to NZMC between 2020-2022, with 60% upheld, showing patterns of:
- Failure to distinguish comment from fact
- Inadequate right of reply
- Lack of balance
- Inaccurate headlines

The historical context shows the Media Council has repeatedly directed Crux to:
- Give subjects proper right of reply before publication
- Clearly distinguish factual information from opinion
- Maintain accuracy in headlines
- Apply ethical journalism standards even in advocacy journalism

This article appears to demonstrate significant improvement in addressing these previously identified weaknesses. The electoral context means heightened scrutiny is appropriate, particularly regarding conflicts of interest and public officials' conduct. The article's investigation of potential conflicts of interest in council contracting serves clear public interest during an election period when voters assess candidate integrity.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**
The article demonstrates strong accuracy throughout:
- Companies Office records are cited to verify shareholding structure (line 13)
- The OAG's November 2023 letter is directly referenced and quoted (lines 31, 59)
- Contract value of $30,000 is confirmed by both OAG approval and QLDC (lines 31, 65)
- Historical contract information from 2022 elections is documented (line 25)
- Mrs Guy's exact Facebook claim is quoted: "I personally am not a shareholder of Rationale" (line 43)

The central factual claim is well-established: Companies Office records show Lisa Guy as a shareholder, contrasting with her Facebook statement. The article accurately captures the nuance that she later clarified she doesn't hold shares "in person" but through the family trust of which she is a trustee (line 95).

**Fairness Issues:**
The article demonstrates exceptional fairness:
- Mrs Guy was given extensive opportunity to respond with two separate sets of responses published in full (lines 79-100)
- QLDC provided detailed response about the contract and procurement (lines 63-76)
- The OAG's full statement is provided (lines 53-61)
- Mrs Guy's perspective is presented comprehensively, including her clarification about holding shares as trustee vs. personally
- The article includes Mrs Guy's policy positions and defenses of her voting record
- No one criticized in the article was denied opportunity to respond

**Balance Issues:**
The article achieves strong balance:
- Multiple perspectives presented: Mrs Guy's views, QLDC's position, OAG's guidance
- Mrs Guy's full responses (approximately 300+ words) are included without apparent editing
- The article presents her explanation that she has "no financial interest" in decisions made (line 97)
- Context is provided for both the shareholding structure and the OAG approval process
- The article notes Mrs Guy's compliance claims alongside the documented restrictions

The article presents the complexity fairly: Mrs Guy technically may be correct that she doesn't hold shares "personally" (in her own name), while also being factually a shareholder via the family trust structure. This nuance is captured rather than sensationalized.

**Evidence:**

"Mrs Guy is the wife of Edward Guy. The Companies Office records that Mrs Guy, together with her husband Edward Guy and EGLG Trustees Ltd (being their two initials â€“ Edward Guy and Lisa Guy), are the majority 74.8% shareholders in Rationale Ltd." (lines 13-14) - Factual, verifiable claim from public records.

"In a response to this feedback Mrs Guy posted on her own QLDC Councillor Facebook page on Tuesday April 9th: 'I personally am not a shareholder of Rationale, I am married to the managing director.'" (lines 43-44) - Direct quote with specific date and platform.

Mrs Guy's subsequent clarification is fully included: "Shareholding: I do not hold any shares of Rationale Ltd in person. I am a trustee of the Guy family trust, which hold shares in Rationale. I have declared pecuniary interest." (line 95) - Her explanation is presented without editorial interpretation.

The OAG's key restriction is prominently quoted: "the approval does not suspend the normal prohibition on Councillor Guy discussing or voting on matters (including these matters) in which she has a financial interest." (line 59) - Critical information for public understanding.

**Findings:**
The article complies with Principle 1. It maintains accuracy by relying on verifiable public records and official statements. It demonstrates fairness by providing extensive right of reply to Mrs Guy and QLDC. It achieves balance by presenting multiple perspectives and allowing subjects to explain their positions fully. The article investigates a matter of clear public interest - potential conflicts of interest in council contracting - while maintaining ethical journalism standards.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The article maintains clear distinction between factual information and opinion/analysis:

**Factual Foundation:**
- Companies Office shareholding records (line 13)
- OAG approval letter from November 2023 (line 31)
- Mrs Guy's Facebook posts with exact quotes and dates (line 43)
- QLDC contract confirmation and value (line 65)
- OAG statement on voting prohibitions (line 59)
- Mrs Guy's Register of Interests declarations (line 49)

**Opinion/Analysis Clearly Identified:**
The article's conclusion section is clearly labeled "Crux's Conclusion" (line 101), separating editorial opinion from factual reporting. The opinion is limited and based on factual foundation:

"Crux will continue to report on this story given the Auditor General's emphasis in their guidance to local government on 'actual, potential or perceived' conflicts of interest." (line 103) - Editorial position clearly identified.

**Presentation of Claims:**
The article's opening presents Mrs Guy as being "at the centre of a gathering storm over what could be seen as a conflict of interest" (line 11) - This uses conditional language ("could be seen as") rather than asserting conflict of interest as fact.

The phrase about a "misleading claim that she's 'not a shareholder'" (line 11) is substantiated by the contradiction between her Facebook statement and Companies Office records. The article then presents her clarification that distinguishes between personal shareholding and trust shareholding, allowing readers to assess the claim.

**Evidence:**

The headline "QLDC councillor makes false shareholding claim" is supported by:
1. Companies Office record showing her as shareholder (line 13)
2. Her Facebook statement "I personally am not a shareholder" (line 43)
3. Her later clarification admitting she's a trustee of a trust that holds shares (line 95)

Whether the claim is "false" or merely incomplete/misleading is a reasonable factual assessment given she is listed as a shareholder in official records while claiming she is not.

The article distinguishes between:
- Verified facts (Companies Office records, OAG letters, contract values)
- Direct quotes from subjects (Mrs Guy, QLDC, OAG)
- Editorial conclusion (clearly labeled as "Crux's Conclusion")

**Findings:**
The article complies with Principle 4. It maintains clear distinction between factual information (supported by documentary evidence) and opinion (clearly labeled in conclusion section). The factual claims are well-documented and verifiable. The article's characterization of Mrs Guy's claim as "false" is a reasonable factual assessment given the documentary evidence, and the article provides her full explanation to give readers complete context.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "QLDC councillor makes false shareholding claim as Rationale gets new contract"

**Accuracy Assessment:**
This headline accurately reflects key elements of the story:
1. "QLDC councillor" - Lisa Guy is a QLDC councillor (established in article)
2. "makes false shareholding claim" - Mrs Guy claimed on Facebook "I personally am not a shareholder of Rationale" while Companies Office records show her as a shareholder
3. "as Rationale gets new contract" - Rationale was awarded a $30,000 contract by QLDC

**Substantiation:**
The claim is "false" in the sense that:
- Companies Office officially lists her as a shareholder (line 13)
- She stated "I personally am not a shareholder" (line 43)
- While she later clarified she holds shares via trust not personally, the official record lists her as shareholder

Whether this rises to "false" vs. "misleading" or "incomplete" could be debated, but it reflects a substantive issue documented in the article.

**Substance Reflection:**
The headline captures the article's two key revelations:
1. The discovery of Mrs Guy's public claim about not being a shareholder
2. The context of a new $30,000 contract to Rationale

The headline does not sensationalize or misrepresent. It states what the article documents: a claim about shareholding that contradicts official records, occurring in the context of a new contract.

**Alternative Considerations:**
More precise alternatives might include:
- "QLDC councillor denies Rationale shareholding despite company records"
- "Councillor Guy's shareholding claim contradicts Companies Office records"

However, "false shareholding claim" is defensible given the documentary evidence. The headline is direct and fact-based rather than editorializing.

**Evidence:**

The headline's claim is substantiated by:
- "In a response to this feedback Mrs Guy posted on her own QLDC Councillor Facebook page on Tuesday April 9th: 'I personally am not a shareholder of Rationale, I am married to the managing director.'" (line 43)
- "The Companies Office records that Mrs Guy, together with her husband Edward Guy and EGLG Trustees Ltd (being their two initials â€“ Edward Guy and Lisa Guy), are the majority 74.8% shareholders in Rationale Ltd." (line 13)

The juxtaposition of these facts supports the headline's characterization.

**Findings:**
The headline complies with Principle 6. It accurately conveys key elements of the story and is substantiated by the article's documented facts. While the term "false" is strong, it reflects a defensible factual assessment given the contradiction between Mrs Guy's public statement and official Companies Office records. The headline is not sensationalized and fairly represents the substance of the article.

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

**Public Interest Context:**
This article investigates potential conflicts of interest in public contracting, which is clearly a matter of public interest:
- QLDC councillor potentially voting on matters affecting her financial interests
- Millions of dollars in public money paid to Rationale for controversial projects
- Electoral context where voters need information about candidate integrity
- OAG guidance on managing conflicts of interest in local government

**Disclosure and Independence:**
The article demonstrates journalistic independence:
- No indication of any relationship between author and subjects
- Investigative approach based on public records and official sources
- No sponsorship or financial inducement evident
- Article serves public interest in government accountability

**Relevant Context Provided:**
The article provides critical context for understanding the conflict of interest issues:
- Historical background on Rationale's QLDC contracts (lines 15-21)
- Previous OAG approvals and restrictions from 2022 (lines 23-27)
- Current OAG approval and voting prohibitions (lines 29-32, 51-61)
- Mrs Guy's voting record on related projects (line 19)
- The distinction between contract approval and voting restrictions

**Transparency:**
The article is transparent about:
- Sources of information (Companies Office, OAG, QLDC, Mrs Guy)
- When information was requested vs. received
- What questions were asked vs. answered (e.g., "Crux asked what the procurement process for the Rationale three waters contract was but the question not answered by the council" - line 69)

**Author-Subject Relationship:**
No conflicts of interest are apparent. The article appears to be standard investigative journalism examining public records and seeking official comment. Peter Newport's role as Crux publisher is known context, and the publication's watchdog role regarding QLDC is established (and subject of previous NZMC complaints regarding methodology, not conflicts).

**Evidence:**

The article's investigation appears motivated by public interest, triggered by Mrs Guy's public Facebook post that drew community attention: "Mrs Guy brought herself into the public spotlight this weekend with an unusual Facebook post... The removal of parking spaces from the CBD, the years of disruption... have all attracted considerable negative attention from local businesses and ratepayers." (lines 35-37)

"Mrs Guy's social media post attracted a lot of public attention and not much of it was positive... But the question of Mrs Guy's role as a councillor while being a shareholder in Rationale also resurfaced." (line 39)

The article's pursuit of the story is explained as response to public concern and Mrs Guy's own statements, not driven by any disclosed or apparent conflict.

**Findings:**
The article complies with Principle 10. It demonstrates journalistic independence, investigates a matter of clear public interest, and shows no evidence of conflicts of interest affecting the reporting. The article serves the public watchdog function by examining potential conflicts in public contracting and public officials' compliance with OAG restrictions.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise privacy concerns. All individuals named (Lisa Guy, Edward Guy) are public figures engaged in public roles:
- Lisa Guy is an elected QLDC councillor
- Edward Guy is managing director of a company receiving public contracts
- The shareholding information is from public Companies Office records
- The matters discussed relate to public council business and governance

The family trust structure (EGLG Trustees Ltd) is relevant to understanding the financial interest and shareholding structure that relates to public contracting and conflict of interest requirements.

Mrs Guy's Register of Interests declaration is referenced (line 49), which is a public document required of elected officials.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2. The article appropriately covers public records and public officials in their public roles.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical/mental disability. The coverage focuses on governance, conflicts of interest, and public contracting without gratuitous emphasis on personal characteristics.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article is clearly presented as news reporting with factual investigation. The only opinion section is clearly labeled "Crux's Conclusion" (line 101), which is limited and based on factual foundation (the OAG's emphasis on "actual, potential or perceived" conflicts of interest).

The article is not presented as a column or blog - it's investigative reporting with clear separation of fact and editorial opinion.

**Findings:**
No issues with Principle 5. The article maintains appropriate boundaries between news reporting and opinion.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article does not appear to rely on confidential sources. Information is attributed to:
- Public Companies Office records
- Mrs Guy's public Facebook posts
- Official OAG statements
- QLDC official responses
- Mrs Guy's direct responses to Crux

No confidentiality issues arise.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. The investigation is based on:
- Public records (Companies Office)
- Public social media posts (Mrs Guy's Facebook)
- Official information requests to public bodies (QLDC, OAG)
- Direct questions to Mrs Guy (to which she responded)

The article represents straightforward investigative journalism using legitimate public interest reporting methods.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text provided does not include photographs or graphics details. Cannot assess from available information.

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Compliance:**

This article demonstrates strong compliance with NZMC principles across all relevant areas:

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - COMPLIANT**: The article maintains accuracy through reliance on verifiable public records, demonstrates fairness by providing extensive right of reply to all subjects, and achieves balance by presenting multiple perspectives comprehensively.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - COMPLIANT**: Clear distinction is maintained between factual information (documented with sources) and opinion (clearly labeled in conclusion section). All factual claims are well-substantiated.

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - COMPLIANT**: The headline accurately reflects key elements of the story and is substantiated by documented facts, though the term "false" is strong but defensible.

4. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - COMPLIANT**: The article demonstrates journalistic independence and serves clear public interest in examining potential conflicts in public contracting.

5. **All other relevant principles - COMPLIANT**: No issues identified with Privacy, Discrimination, or other applicable principles.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This article represents a significant contrast to Crux's historical NZMC complaints pattern. Previous upheld complaints (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356) found Crux failed to:
- Give adequate right of reply before publication
- Maintain clear distinction between fact and opinion
- Ensure accuracy in headlines
- Exercise professional conduct

**This article demonstrates improvement:**

1. **Extensive Right of Reply**: Unlike Case 3356 where Crux's contact efforts were called "paltry," this article includes comprehensive responses from Mrs Guy (two separate sets of responses totaling 300+ words) and full QLDC comment.

2. **Fact/Opinion Distinction**: Unlike Cases 2891, 2895, and 2940 where opinion was "liberally sprinkled through story presented as news," this article maintains clear boundaries with opinion confined to a labeled conclusion section.

3. **Accurate Headlines**: Unlike Cases 2940 and 3356 where headlines were found inaccurate, this headline is substantiated by documentary evidence, though strong in characterization.

4. **Professional Conduct**: Unlike Case 2940's "hostile email exchanges" and Case 3356's failure to "seriously engage," this article presents professional investigative journalism with proper sourcing and response opportunities.

**Public Interest Justification:**

The article serves legitimate public interest by examining:
- Potential conflicts of interest in public contracting
- Compliance with OAG restrictions on councillor voting
- Transparency in council procurement
- Electoral accountability (voters' right to know about candidate integrity)
- Accuracy of public statements by elected officials

The investigation is proportionate to the public interest: it documents a contradiction between a councillor's public statement and official records, in the context of new public contracts and voting restrictions.

---

**Electoral Context:**

The ReviewContext.MD indicates local government elections are underway. This electoral context is relevant because:

1. **Heightened Public Interest**: Voters need accurate information about candidates' conflicts of interest and compliance with governance requirements.

2. **Legitimate Scrutiny**: Examination of elected officials' financial interests and voting restrictions is particularly important during elections when voters assess candidate integrity.

3. **No Electoral Advantage Issues**: Unlike the Niki Gladding review where one candidate received uncritical campaign platform, this article does not provide electoral advantage. It investigates factual questions about conflicts of interest relevant to voters' decision-making.

4. **Balance Maintained**: The article provides extensive opportunity for Mrs Guy to explain her position, present her compliance arguments, and clarify the shareholding structure. This is appropriate electoral coverage.

The article's timing during an election period makes the investigation more, not less, appropriate given the public interest in understanding candidates' potential conflicts.

---

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, **there are no strong grounds for a formal complaint** to NZMC. The article demonstrates compliance with relevant NZMC principles.

**If a complaint were to be considered, the only potential grounds would be:**

**Possible Issue - Headline Characterization:**
- The headline's use of "false shareholding claim" could be challenged as overly strong characterization
- Mrs Guy could argue her claim "I personally am not a shareholder" is technically accurate if interpreted as "not a shareholder in my personal name"
- However, this defense is weak because:
  - Companies Office officially lists her as a shareholder
  - Public understanding of "not a shareholder" would include trust shareholdings for a family trust where she's trustee and beneficiary
  - Her subsequent clarification acknowledged the shareholding via trust, suggesting the original claim was at minimum incomplete

**Counter-arguments to any complaint:**

1. **Strong Factual Foundation**: The article is thoroughly documented with public records, official statements, and extensive subject responses.

2. **Exceptional Fairness**: Mrs Guy was given extensive opportunity to respond with full publication of her explanations and defenses.

3. **Public Interest**: The investigation serves clear public interest in conflict of interest compliance, particularly during an election period.

4. **Accuracy**: All factual claims are substantiated and verifiable. The characterization of the claim as "false" is defensible given documentary evidence.

5. **Balance**: Multiple perspectives are presented, including full context from all relevant parties.

**Likely NZMC Response:**

If a complaint were filed, NZMC would likely:
- Find the article compliant with principles
- Note the strong factual foundation and extensive right of reply
- Recognize the legitimate public interest in examining conflicts of interest
- Possibly note the headline is strong but substantiated
- Decline to uphold any complaint

---

**Strategic Assessment:**

**Strengths of This Article as NZMC Precedent:**

This article could serve as a positive example of:
- How to investigate conflicts of interest while maintaining fairness
- Providing adequate right of reply to subjects of criticism
- Distinguishing between fact and opinion
- Investigating public interest matters during elections

**Contrast with Previous Crux Failures:**

Where previous upheld complaints found Crux failed basic ethical standards, this article demonstrates:
- Serious attempts to obtain comment (not "paltry efforts")
- Clear fact/opinion boundaries (not "opinion liberally sprinkled")
- Accurate headlines (not speculation stated as fact)
- Professional engagement with subjects

**Public Interest Value:**

The article serves democracy by:
- Examining conflicts of interest in public contracting
- Verifying accuracy of public officials' statements
- Providing voters with relevant information about governance compliance
- Highlighting OAG restrictions on councillor voting

**Comparison to Niki Gladding Article:**

Unlike the Niki Gladding article which:
- Provided uncritical campaign platform
- Denied right of reply to those criticized
- Presented opinion as fact
- Failed to disclose electoral context adequately

This article:
- Investigates factual questions with documentary evidence
- Provides extensive right of reply
- Clearly distinguishes fact from opinion
- Serves legitimate electoral accountability function

---

**Required Actions per NZMC Procedure:**

**No complaint recommended.**

If Mrs Guy wished to pursue a complaint despite the strong compliance, she would need to:

**Step 1 - Complaint to Publisher (Crux):**
- **Timing**: Within one calendar month of first publication (April 10, 2024)
- **Deadline**: Would have been May 10, 2024
- **Status**: This deadline has long passed (review conducted October 3, 2025)
- **Conclusion**: No complaint to publisher is now possible under NZMC procedures

**Note on Timing:**
Even if there were grounds for complaint (which this analysis finds there are not), the one-month deadline has passed, making any complaint procedurally barred unless the NZMC Chair exercises discretion to extend time limits under exceptional circumstances.

---

**Alternative Actions:**

Rather than formal complaint, if Mrs Guy wished to address the article, more appropriate actions would be:

1. **Right of Reply**: Request Crux publish additional clarification or response (though extensive responses were already published in the original article).

2. **Correction Request**: If any specific factual errors exist (though none are identified in this review), request correction.

3. **Public Clarification**: Continue using her own platforms (Facebook, council communications) to explain the shareholding structure and compliance with OAG requirements.

Given that the article already included Mrs Guy's full explanations and the Companies Office records are publicly verifiable facts, additional remedies appear unnecessary.

---

**Conclusion:**

This article represents compliant investigative journalism examining a matter of clear public interest - potential conflicts of interest in public contracting and an elected official's public statements about shareholding. The article maintains accuracy through reliance on verifiable public records, demonstrates fairness by providing extensive right of reply, and achieves balance by presenting multiple perspectives comprehensively.

The article shows significant improvement from Crux's historical NZMC compliance issues, particularly in providing adequate right of reply, maintaining fact/opinion boundaries, and conducting professional investigative journalism. While the headline characterization is strong, it is substantiated by documentary evidence showing contradiction between the councillor's public statement and official records.

No formal complaint is warranted. The article serves legitimate public interest in government accountability and electoral transparency while maintaining ethical journalism standards. The extensive responses published from Mrs Guy ensure her perspective is fairly represented, allowing readers to assess the shareholding structure and conflict of interest issues with full information.

This article demonstrates that rigorous investigative journalism examining conflicts of interest can be conducted while fully complying with NZMC principles when proper right of reply, factual accuracy, and balanced presentation are maintained.
