# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Facebook Post: QLDC Engineer Writes Own $448,000 Consulting Deal
**Publication:** Crux (Facebook)
**Date:** August 10, 2022
**Author:** Crux
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This Facebook post promoted Crux's article about QLDC consultant Andrew Tipene with inflammatory language ("jobs for mates") and a comment section that revealed significant privacy breaches and professional conduct issues. The post and Crux's subsequent comments raise serious concerns under multiple NZMC principles, particularly regarding privacy (publishing personal contact information), accuracy and fairness (unverified industry allegations in comments), and conflicts of interest (allegations of fake profiles and manipulation). This social media post demonstrates the broader ethical failures that led to the related article being upheld by NZMC in Case 3356.

---

## Article Summary
The Facebook post consists of:
1. **Main Post Text:** Alleges QLDC staffer left to work as consultant "with none of the council's 'jobs for mates' rules being followed"
2. **Linked Article:** "QLDC engineer writes own $448,000 consulting deal" about Andrew Tipene
3. **Crux Comment/Update:** Allegations about Jostin Loke, fake profile "Andrew Tumeke" resembling Andrew Tipene, and claims about QLDC logo on personal gmail
4. **Public Comments:** Including criticism of Crux for publishing personal contact info, industry allegations against Tipene, and various public commentary

The post generated 51 comments and 2 shares with strong emotional reactions (angry faces). Notably, Kath Ryn criticized Crux for publishing personal email and phone number in the underlying article (line 39).

---

## Context Considerations

**Historical NZMC Context:**
This Facebook post relates directly to NZMC Case 3356 (December 2022), where Crux's underlying article about Andrew Tipene was **UPHELD** for breaches of Principles 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance) and 6 (Headlines). The Media Council found:
- Crux should have given Tipene opportunity to comment before publication
- Claim they couldn't find contact details was "clearly wrong" - they had his email
- "Reliance only on social media seems a paltry effort"
- Council was **"disappointed by Crux's conduct"**
- Crux **"does not appear to have seriously engaged with Mr Tipene in relation to his specific complaints"**

**Pattern of Conduct:**
By August 2022, this was already at least the **5th complaint** from QLDC, its subsidiaries, or contractors. The Media Council had previously found (Case 2940, Sept 2020) a **"serious breakdown in professional relationship"** with **"festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism marked by stonewalling and hostile email exchanges."**

**Current Review Context:**
ReviewContext.MD indicates Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections are underway. Crux is a local news site with a history of NZMC complaints and directions. This post occurred in 2022, but the pattern it demonstrates remains relevant to understanding Crux's ongoing conduct.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The most significant issue raised in the comments is Kath Ryn's criticism: "Not cool publishing his personal email and phone number in your story." (line 39) This received 9 reactions, indicating community concern about the privacy breach.

**Privacy Rights:**
While Andrew Tipene was a public contractor dealing with QLDC (a public body), publishing his personal contact information goes beyond legitimate public interest:
- Personal email addresses and phone numbers are private information
- Their publication serves no journalistic purpose
- It exposes the individual to harassment and unwanted contact
- The public interest in council spending does not require disclosure of personal contact details

**Lack of Public Interest Justification:**
There is no legitimate reason to publish personal contact information:
- The story concerns procurement practices and contract amounts (public interest)
- It does not require readers to personally contact Andrew Tipene
- Professional contact through QLDC or business channels would be appropriate if needed
- Personal contact details add nothing to the public interest story

**Crux's Response:**
Notably, Crux did not respond to Kath Ryn's criticism or acknowledge the privacy breach. Instead, their update comment focused on allegations about "Jostin Loke" and "fake profiles" (lines 31-32).

**Evidence:**

"Not cool publishing his personal email and phone number in your story." (line 39) - Direct criticism of privacy breach with 9 reactions showing community concern.

The Facebook post itself does not show the contact details, but the linked article evidently contained them, and Crux's Facebook platform amplified the article containing this breach.

**Findings:**
This constitutes a clear breach of Principle 2. Personal email addresses and phone numbers are private information that should be protected. While the council spending story involves public interest, publishing personal contact details serves no journalistic purpose and exposes Tipene to potential harassment. The NZMC principle states "Everyone is normally entitled to privacy of person, space and personal information and these rights should be respected by publications." This was violated. The fact this privacy breach was later cited in the NZMC Case 3356 complaint further validates this concern.

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Unverified Allegations in Comments:**
The comment section contains serious unverified allegations that Crux allowed to stand without moderation or correction:

Mike James states: "I work in the industry and Andrew Tipene appears to milk money out of the council engineering approval process by pulling up lots of pedantic engineering RFIs and costs 3 times what it should." (lines 49-50)

This is a serious professional allegation of:
- Deliberately inflating costs
- Making unnecessary requests for information (RFIs)
- Charging 3x normal rates
- Effectively defrauding clients

**No Verification:**
- No evidence Mike James actually works "in the industry"
- No verification of claims about "pedantic RFIs"
- No substantiation of "3 times what it should" cost claim
- No right of reply for Tipene to these allegations
- Crux's platform allowed unverified allegations to damage professional reputation

**Crux's Own Unverified Allegations:**
Crux's update comment makes serious allegations without evidence:
- Claims about "Jostin Loke posting accusations against Crux in partnership with fake profile Andrew Tumeke"
- Allegation "Andrew Tumeke bears a striking resemblance to Andrew Tipene"
- Claim Tipene/Tumeke "pasted QLDC official logo onto his personal gmail account" (line 31)

These allegations suggest:
- Identity fraud (fake profiles)
- Impersonation
- Misuse of official government logos
- Coordination between parties to attack Crux

**No Supporting Evidence Provided:**
- No screenshots of the alleged fake profile
- No evidence of the gmail logo misuse
- No documentation of "partnership" between Loke and Tumeke/Tipene
- Just assertions presented as discovered facts

**Fairness Issues:**
Multiple parties are attacked or criticized without fair opportunity to respond:
- Andrew Tipene (subject of article, alleged fake profile creator)
- Jostin Loke (accused of making accusations "in partnership" with fake profile)
- Neither given opportunity to respond in the post or comments

**Context from NZMC Case 3356:**
The Media Council found Crux "should have given Tipene opportunity to comment before publication." This Facebook post compounds that unfairness by allowing unverified allegations in comments and making additional serious allegations without evidence.

**Evidence:**

Original post: "We've discovered another QLDC staffer who left the council to start work immediately as a consultant - with none of the council's 'jobs for mates' rules being followed." (line 11) - Serious allegation with no evidence of which specific rules were violated or how.

Mike James: "Andrew Tipene appears to milk money out of the council engineering approval process by pulling up lots of pedantic engineering RFIs and costs 3 times what it should." (lines 49-50) - Unverified professional allegation allowed to stand.

Crux update: "We have been in touch with Jostin Loke and discovered he is posting accusations against Crux in partnership with the fake profile Andrew Tumeke - who bears a striking resemblance to Andrew Tipene." (lines 31-32) - Serious allegations of fake profiles and identity fraud without evidence.

Phil Andrew: "There needs to be criminal investigations as potential white collar crime" (line 59) - Allegation of criminality based on Crux's reporting.

**Findings:**
This constitutes a breach of Principle 1. The post and comment section contain multiple unverified allegations that damage reputations without evidence or right of reply. Crux's own update comment makes serious allegations about fake profiles and logo misuse without supporting evidence. The platform allowed professional attacks on Tipene to proliferate without moderation. Publications must be "bound at all times by accuracy, fairness and balance and should not deliberately mislead or misinform readers by commission or omission."

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The Facebook post and Crux's comments systematically blur the line between fact and opinion/speculation:

**"Jobs for Mates" Characterization:**
The post states: "with none of the council's 'jobs for mates' rules being followed" (line 11)
- "Jobs for mates" is opinion/characterization, not neutral fact
- No evidence provided which specific rules were violated
- Implies corrupt favoritism as established fact
- Actually a political/editorial judgment about procurement practices

**"Wrote His Own $448,000 Consulting Deal":**
The headline claim (line 17) presents as fact that:
- Tipene "wrote" the deal himself
- The amount was $448,861 total
- This was improper or unusual

NZMC Case 3356 found the headline inaccurate - it mischaracterized an "Offer of Service" as a completed contract. The actual contract terms may have differed.

**Crux Update - Speculation as Fact:**
"We have been in touch with Jostin Loke and discovered he is posting accusations against Crux in partnership with the fake profile Andrew Tumeke - who bears a striking resemblance to Andrew Tipene." (lines 31-32)

This presents as factual "discovery":
- That Andrew Tumeke is a "fake profile" (opinion/conclusion)
- That Tumeke "bears a striking resemblance to Andrew Tipene" (implies same person)
- That there is a "partnership" between Loke and Tumeke (speculation)
- That Tipene/Tumeke used QLDC logo on personal gmail (serious allegation)

None of this is presented as "we believe" or "appears to be" - it's stated as discovered fact.

**Comment Section Opinion as Fact:**
Mike James: "Andrew Tipene appears to milk money out of the council engineering approval process" (line 49)
- Uses word "appears" but makes factual claims about process manipulation
- Presents opinion about professional conduct as industry fact
- No clear distinction between his view and established fact

**No Clear Labeling:**
The post is not labeled as opinion or commentary. It appears as news update with factual claims. The "Story Update" from Crux (line 30) particularly presents investigative findings as fact when they are allegations and interpretations.

**Evidence:**

Main post: "none of the council's 'jobs for mates' rules being followed" (line 11) - Opinion characterization presented as fact.

Linked article headline: "QLDC engineer writes own $448,000 consulting deal" (line 17) - Found inaccurate by NZMC.

Crux update: "discovered he is posting accusations against Crux in partnership with the fake profile Andrew Tumeke - who bears a striking resemblance to Andrew Tipene" (lines 31-32) - Speculation and allegations presented as discovered facts.

"Thanks to Mr Loke we have discovered that Mr Tipene/Tumeke did in fact paste the QLDC official logo onto his personal gmail account." (line 31) - Serious allegation presented as verified fact with no supporting evidence shown.

**Findings:**
This constitutes a breach of Principle 4. The post and Crux's comments fail to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion, speculation, or allegation. Characterizations like "jobs for mates" are presented as fact. Serious allegations about fake profiles and logo misuse are stated as "discovered" facts without evidence. The principle requires: "A clear distinction should be drawn between factual information and comment or opinion."

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Allegations of Profile Manipulation:**
Crux's update alleges: "Jostin Loke...is posting accusations against Crux in partnership with the fake profile Andrew Tumeke - who bears a striking resemblance to Andrew Tipene" (lines 31-32)

If true, this would indicate:
- Fake social media profiles being used to attack or defend in the discussion
- Potential coordination between parties
- Manipulation of public discourse on the issue
- Misrepresentation of identity in public debate

**Crux's Conflict:**
However, Crux itself has a conflict:
- It is making allegations about critics being "fake profiles"
- This serves to discredit criticism of its reporting
- No evidence provided to support the allegations
- Could be weaponizing "fake profile" accusations to dismiss valid concerns

**Logo Misuse Allegations:**
"Mr Tipene/Tumeke did in fact paste the QLDC official logo onto his personal gmail account" (line 31)

This serious allegation of:
- Misrepresenting official authority
- Potential impersonation of council official
- Using government branding inappropriately

Should be disclosed with evidence if true, but:
- No evidence provided (screenshot, email headers, etc.)
- Could be defamatory if false
- Serves Crux's interest to discredit subject's response

**Lack of Disclosure:**
The post should disclose:
- Any evidence of the alleged fake profiles and logo misuse
- How Crux determined "striking resemblance" between Tumeke and Tipene
- What Jostin Loke's relationship is to the story
- Whether this is speculation or verified fact

**Pattern from NZMC History:**
Case 2940 (Sept 2020) found "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" between Crux and QLDC entities, with Crux apologizing for hostile email tone. This Facebook update suggests similar antagonistic pattern - making serious allegations about manipulation and fake profiles when criticized.

**Evidence:**

Crux update: "We have been in touch with Jostin Loke and discovered he is posting accusations against Crux in partnership with the fake profile Andrew Tumeke - who bears a striking resemblance to Andrew Tipene." (lines 31-32)

"Thanks to Mr Loke we have discovered that Mr Tipene/Tumeke did in fact paste the QLDC official logo onto his personal gmail account." (line 31)

"Thanks to all of the genuine people who have posted genuine comments on this story. More to come." (line 32) - Implies others are not "genuine," serving Crux's interest in discrediting critics.

**Findings:**
This constitutes a potential breach of Principle 10. Crux makes serious allegations about fake profiles and logo misuse that serve to discredit critics of its reporting, without providing evidence. If these allegations are true, they should be properly disclosed with evidence. If they are speculation or unfounded, making them publicly damages reputations and manipulates discourse. The principle requires disclosure of conflicts and relationships, and avoiding situations that compromise independence. Using unsubstantiated "fake profile" allegations to dismiss criticism potentially compromises journalistic independence and credibility.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Breach (via linked article)

**Analysis:**

**Linked Article Headline:**
"QLDC engineer writes own $448,000 consulting deal" (line 17)

NZMC Case 3356 specifically upheld a complaint against this headline, finding:
- The headline was inaccurate
- It mischaracterized what was actually an "Offer of Service" as a completed contract
- The headline implied Tipene improperly "wrote his own deal"

**Facebook Post Text as Headline:**
"We've discovered another QLDC staffer who left the council to start work immediately as a consultant - with none of the council's 'jobs for mates' rules being followed." (line 11)

This functions as the social media headline and:
- Characterizes the situation as "jobs for mates" (loaded, opinionated framing)
- Claims "none of the council's rules being followed" without specifying which rules or providing evidence
- Presents serious allegations as discovered fact
- Does not accurately convey balanced reporting

**Misleading Summary:**
The linked article summary states: "An engineer who spent 18 months with the Queenstown Lakes District Council as an employee then wrote his own consulting terms that resulted in a total of $448,861 being paid..." (line 19)

This summary:
- Reinforces the inaccurate "wrote his own" characterization
- Presents the dollar amount as completed payment (may have been offer or projection)
- Implies impropriety without evidence

**Evidence:**

Facebook post: "with none of the council's 'jobs for mates' rules being followed" (line 11) - Inaccurate, opinionated characterization.

Linked article headline: "QLDC engineer writes own $448,000 consulting deal" (line 17) - Found inaccurate and unfair by NZMC Case 3356.

Article summary: "then wrote his own consulting terms that resulted in a total of $448,861 being paid" (line 19) - Reinforces inaccurate characterization.

**Findings:**
This constitutes a breach of Principle 6, as confirmed by NZMC Case 3356 upholding the complaint against the headline. The Facebook post text and linked article summary similarly fail to "accurately and fairly convey the substance or a key element of the report." The characterizations are misleading and opinionated rather than accurate and fair.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Social Media as Opinion Platform:**
The Facebook post and Crux's subsequent comments function as opinion and commentary, but:
- Not clearly identified as opinion vs. news reporting
- Crux's update presents investigative "discoveries" as fact
- No clear distinction between Crux's news role and opinion/advocacy role
- Comment section becomes extension of Crux's attack on subject

**Foundation of Fact Issues:**
Even if treated as opinion content, the post lacks proper factual foundation:
- "Jobs for mates" characterization not supported by specific rule violations
- Fake profile allegations not supported by evidence
- Gmail logo misuse claim not documented
- "Costs 3 times what it should" claim (Mike James) not verified

**Publisher Responsibility for Comments:**
While comment sections often contain user opinion, Crux has responsibility when:
- Serious professional allegations appear (Mike James comment)
- Privacy breaches are criticized (Kath Ryn comment) and ignored
- Comment section amplifies unfair attacks
- Publisher's own comments add unverified allegations

NZMC principles apply to "published material" which includes social media posts and could extend to comment sections where publisher actively participates and moderates.

**Evidence:**

Crux's active participation in comments: "Story Update: We have been in touch with Jostin Loke and discovered..." (line 30) - Publisher using comment section to make additional serious allegations.

"Thanks to all of the genuine people who have posted genuine comments on this story." (line 32) - Publisher endorsing some comments as "genuine" while implying others are not.

Mike James professional attack allowed to stand without moderation or correction (lines 49-50).

Kath Ryn's privacy concern ignored by Crux (line 39).

**Findings:**
This constitutes a potential breach of Principle 5. While social media posts may be understood as having opinion elements, Crux's active participation in the comment section making serious allegations, combined with failure to moderate unverified professional attacks, suggests publisher responsibility for the content. The post and comments lack proper factual foundation and blur the line between reporting and opinion without clear identification.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The post and comments do not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical or mental disability. The criticism and allegations relate to professional conduct and procurement practices, not protected characteristics.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this post.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The post does not appear to rely on confidential sources or raise confidentiality issues. Information appears to be from public records (council contracts) and public social media interactions.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Not Directly Applicable

However, the allegations Crux makes about others using fake profiles and misusing logos could themselves constitute subterfuge if Crux is making unfounded allegations to manipulate discourse. The lack of evidence for these serious claims is concerning.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No photographs or graphics details are provided in the text. Cannot assess from available information.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 2 (Privacy) - BREACH**: Publishing personal email and phone number in the linked article, as criticized by community member Kath Ryn. Personal contact information serves no journalistic purpose and exposes Tipene to harassment. Clear violation of privacy rights.

2. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**:
   - Unverified professional allegations in comments allowed to stand (Mike James claiming Tipene "milks money" and charges "3 times" normal rates)
   - Crux's own unverified allegations about fake profiles and logo misuse without evidence
   - "Jobs for mates" characterization without specific evidence of rule violations
   - No right of reply for those attacked
   - Later confirmed by NZMC Case 3356 upholding lack of fairness and balance

3. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**:
   - Opinion and speculation presented as fact ("jobs for mates," "fake profile," logo misuse)
   - No clear distinction between factual claims and allegations
   - Crux "discoveries" about fake profiles presented as fact without evidence
   - Not clearly labeled as opinion/commentary vs. news

4. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - BREACH**:
   - Linked article headline found inaccurate by NZMC Case 3356
   - Facebook post text characterizations misleading ("none of the council's rules being followed")
   - Summary reinforces inaccurate "wrote his own deal" narrative

5. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**:
   - Serious allegations about fake profiles and logo misuse without evidence
   - Allegations serve to discredit critics of Crux's reporting
   - Lack of disclosure about evidence or verification of claims
   - Pattern of antagonistic relationship with QLDC entities

6. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**:
   - Social media post not clearly identified as opinion
   - Active publisher participation in comments making additional allegations
   - Lack of factual foundation for claims
   - Failure to moderate unverified attacks

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This Facebook post exemplifies the broader pattern of ethical failures that led to NZMC Case 3356 being upheld:

1. **Privacy Violations**: Publishing personal contact information with no journalistic justification, exposing subject to harassment.

2. **Unverified Allegations**: Making serious claims about fake profiles, logo misuse, and professional misconduct without evidence or verification.

3. **Lack of Right of Reply**: Neither Tipene nor Jostin Loke were given opportunity to respond to serious allegations made in Crux's update comment.

4. **Hostile Engagement Pattern**: The update comment demonstrates the "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" previously identified by NZMC in Case 2940.

5. **Comment Section Amplification**: Allowing unverified professional attacks (Mike James) to stand while using comment section to make additional allegations.

6. **Fact/Opinion Confusion**: Presenting allegations, speculation, and opinion as discovered facts throughout post and comments.

7. **Weaponizing "Fake Profile" Allegations**: Using unsubstantiated claims about fake profiles to discredit critics and responses, without evidence.

**NZMC Case 3356 Validation:**
The Media Council's December 2022 decision to uphold the complaint against the underlying article validates many concerns raised in this review. The Council found:
- Crux should have given Tipene right of reply before publication
- Claims about inability to contact him were "clearly wrong"
- "Reliance only on social media seems a paltry effort"
- Council was "disappointed by Crux's conduct"
- Crux did not seriously engage with complainant's specific concerns

This Facebook post compounds those failures by adding:
- Privacy breach (personal contact information)
- Additional unverified allegations in comments
- Platform for professional attacks without moderation
- Further allegations about fake profiles without evidence

---

**Professional Conduct Issues:**

Beyond specific principle breaches, this post demonstrates concerning professional conduct:

1. **Defensive Aggression**: Responding to criticism with allegations about fake profiles and manipulation rather than addressing privacy concerns.

2. **Lack of Evidence**: Making serious allegations (fake profiles, logo misuse) without providing supporting evidence.

3. **Dismissing Valid Criticism**: Kath Ryn's privacy concern (9 reactions) was ignored while Crux focused on attacking critics.

4. **Comment Section Management**: Failing to moderate unverified professional attacks while using comments to make additional allegations.

5. **Antagonistic Pattern**: Continuing the "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" identified by NZMC in earlier cases.

**Consistency with Historical Pattern:**
This post occurred in August 2022, after:
- Case 2891 (March 2020) - UPHELD for lack of balance and fact/opinion issues
- Case 2895 (May 2020) - Not upheld but "strongly suggests Crux take greater care"
- Case 2940 (Sept 2020) - UPHELD, noting "serious breakdown in professional relationship"
- Case 3012 (March 2021) - Not upheld but noted "sloppy" reporting

By August 2022, Crux had received multiple NZMC rulings and warnings but this post demonstrates continued failures in:
- Privacy protection
- Verification before publication
- Right of reply
- Fact/opinion distinction
- Professional conduct

The subsequent NZMC Case 3356 (December 2022) upheld complaint confirms these failures culminated in another breach ruling.

**Review Methodology:**

This review was conducted by:
1. Close reading of Facebook post and all visible comments
2. Analysis against all relevant NZMC Statement of Principles
3. Cross-reference with NZMC Case 3356 findings (same subject matter)
4. Review of historical pattern from previous NZMC cases against Crux
5. Consideration of privacy, fairness, and professional conduct issues
6. Assessment of social media platform responsibilities

**Objectivity and Limitations:**

Reviewers should note:
- Analysis based on text provided; complete Facebook post with images may contain additional relevant content
- Cannot verify actual contents of linked article beyond summary provided
- Mike James's claim to work "in the industry" not independently verified
- Fake profile allegations cannot be verified from this text alone
- Review assumes post is accurate representation of what was published
- NZMC may weigh social media context differently than print articles

**Key Principles Applied in This Review:**

1. **Evidence-Based**: All findings cite specific passages from post and comments
2. **Proportionate**: Distinguishes between clear breaches, potential breaches, and compliant content
3. **Contextual**: Considers NZMC Case 3356 findings and historical pattern
4. **Practical**: Notes timing issues but identifies principles violated
5. **Balanced**: Acknowledges public interest in council spending while upholding privacy and fairness standards
6. **Pattern-Aware**: Recognizes this as part of broader conduct pattern, not isolated incident

---

**Conclusion:**

This Facebook post demonstrates significant failures across multiple NZMC principles, most notably privacy breaches and unverified allegations without right of reply. The post exemplifies the broader pattern of ethical failures that led to NZMC Case 3356 being upheld against the related article.

**Key Findings:**

1. **Privacy Breach**: Publishing personal contact information serves no journalistic purpose and exposes subject to harassment - clear violation of Principle 2.

2. **Unverified Allegations**: Serious claims about fake profiles, logo misuse, and professional misconduct made without evidence or verification - breach of Principle 1.

3. **No Right of Reply**: Neither Tipene nor Jostin Loke given opportunity to respond to serious allegations - breach of Principle 1.

4. **Fact/Opinion Confusion**: Allegations and speculation presented as discovered facts without clear distinction - breach of Principle 4.

5. **Hostile Engagement**: Pattern of attacking critics rather than addressing valid concerns (privacy), consistent with NZMC's previous finding of "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism."

6. **Comment Section Failures**: Unverified professional attacks allowed to stand while publisher uses comments to make additional allegations.

**Significance:**

While this specific post is too old for formal complaint, it provides crucial evidence of:
- Pattern of conduct spanning years and multiple NZMC rulings
- Failure to learn from NZMC guidance and warnings
- Privacy breaches beyond fairness issues addressed in Case 3356
- Professional conduct issues in social media engagement
- Use of unverified allegations to discredit critics

**Pattern Context:**

This August 2022 post occurred:
- After three previous NZMC rulings (two upheld, one with strong warnings)
- During period NZMC identified "serious breakdown in professional relationship"
- Four months before Case 3356 would be upheld
- As part of pattern of at least 5 complaints from QLDC entities/contractors

The post demonstrates that despite repeated NZMC guidance, Crux continued practices that breach fundamental principles of accuracy, fairness, privacy, and professional conduct.

**Value for Current Complaints:**

This review provides:
1. Historical evidence of privacy breach patterns
2. Documentation of hostile engagement with critics
3. Examples of unverified allegations presented as fact
4. Context showing consistent ethical failures across multiple years
5. Support for pattern arguments in current complaints about similar conduct

The Facebook post, combined with the later NZMC Case 3356 upholding, demonstrates a clear pattern of ethical failures that persisted despite repeated Media Council rulings and guidance.
