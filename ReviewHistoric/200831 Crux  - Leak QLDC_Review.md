# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Crux leak: QLDC investigation finds Niki Gladding guilty of "serious breach."

## Executive Summary
This article reports on an investigation into Councillor Niki Gladding's leak of confidential QLDC information to Crux. While the article provides extensive coverage of Gladding's perspective and quotes from her interview, it fails to provide adequate balance by not seeking comment from QLDC officials, the mayor, or other councillors affected by her actions. The article also contains misleading characterizations of a previous NZMC ruling. Multiple NZMC principles appear to have been breached, particularly regarding accuracy, fairness and balance (Principle 1), and the distinction between fact and comment (Principle 4).

---

## Article Summary
The article reports on the release of an investigation report finding Councillor Niki Gladding guilty of a "serious breach" of QLDC's Code of Conduct for leaking confidential information to Crux about "wide body jets" at Wanaka airport. The article presents:
- The investigation's findings and recommendations for Gladding
- Extensive quotes from Gladding defending her actions and expressing no regret
- Gladding's claims that QLDC managers plan to avoid discussion at Thursday's council meeting
- Reference to a previous NZMC complaint by QLDC against Crux that was "partially upheld"
- Gladding's stated view that she felt conflicted between duty to the public and duty to council
- Information that Gladding will keep her committee positions

The article provides substantial platform to Gladding's justifications and criticisms of QLDC without seeking comment from QLDC officials, other councillors, the mayor, or council management about the breach or Gladding's characterizations.

---

## Context Considerations
According to ReviewContext.MD, Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council. This article itself references a previous NZMC complaint that was "partially upheld" - a matter directly relevant to the story being reported.

The article involves a serious finding of Code of Conduct breach by a councillor, which is a matter of significant public interest. The leak concerned public statements about airport planning and whether wide body jets were being considered for Wanaka airport.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**

The article contains a significant inaccuracy regarding the previous NZMC complaint:

"The complaint was partially upheld and centred on whether Crux had given QLDC sufficient right of reply in our coverage." (line 18)

This characterization is misleading. The article states the complaint was "partially upheld" when describing what was found against Crux, but provides no detail about what aspects were upheld versus what aspects were not upheld. The phrasing minimizes the seriousness of the upheld portions by emphasizing it was only "partial" without explaining what was actually found in breach.

The article also presents Gladding's claims as fact without verification:
- "Councillor Gladding has told Crux today that council managers plan to avoid having the investigation discussed at Thursday's council meeting" (lines 20-21) - This serious claim about managerial conduct is presented without verification from council managers or any evidence beyond Gladding's assertion.
- "Nothing leads me to believe that the wide body jets reference was a mistake." (line 16) - Gladding's belief is presented without any counter-evidence or expert analysis of the consultant's report.

**Fairness Issues:**

The article is fundamentally unfair in its treatment of multiple parties:

1. **QLDC Council and Management**: The investigation found Gladding guilty of a "serious breach" of the Code of Conduct, yet the article provides extensive platform for Gladding to:
   - Justify her breach ("still felt the move was justified" - line 14)
   - Criticize QLDC for allegedly avoiding discussion (lines 20-21)
   - Claim QLDC should look at its own policies (line 21)
   - Frame her breach as being caught between competing duties (lines 23-25)

   No opportunity for right of reply is provided to:
   - QLDC management accused of planning to "avoid having the investigation discussed"
   - The mayor or council leadership regarding governance issues
   - Other councillors who were affected by the breach (line 25 acknowledges "it did cause an issue for other councillors")
   - The investigator whose recommendations are characterized selectively

2. **The Investigation Process**: The article mentions "scathing investigation report" and "serious breach" findings but then provides extensive space for the subject of that adverse finding to dispute it without balancing perspectives from those who conducted or commissioned the investigation.

3. **Other Councillors**: The article states Gladding's breach "did cause an issue for other councillors" (line 25) but provides no voice to those affected councillors about the impact on their work or the council's functioning.

**Balance Issues:**

The article is substantially one-sided:
- Approximately 60% of the article consists of Gladding's direct quotes or her perspective
- No quotes or perspectives from QLDC officials, management, mayor, or other councillors
- No independent assessment of whether Gladding's justifications have merit
- No exploration of the investigation's reasoning or the seriousness of Code of Conduct breaches
- No context about confidentiality requirements for councillors or why they exist

The article's treatment of the NZMC complaint issue demonstrates the imbalance particularly clearly - Crux references its own previous breach but characterizes it minimally ("partially upheld") without explaining what was actually found wrong with their coverage, while providing extensive detail to Gladding's justifications for conduct now found to be a breach.

**Evidence:**

"Speaking to Crux this afternoon, after the release of the investigation report as part of a Council Agenda for later this week, Niki Gladding said that she was sorry for what she had done but still felt the move was justified." (lines 14-15) - This sets up the entire article's framing: despite being found guilty of "serious breach," her justification is the focus.

"Councillor Gladding has told Crux today that council managers plan to avoid having the investigation discussed at Thursday's council meeting" (lines 20-21) - Serious allegation of managerial misconduct with no verification or right of reply.

"I didn't want to hang on to that knowledge myself, knowing that we had said the opposite in public. It was a tricky situation and I understand that it did cause an issue for other councillors. I'm happy to take the consequences for it, but it would be great if the council was to look at the context around this situation, to sit down and talk about it. To figure out how they can maybe do things differently in the future" (lines 25-26) - Extensive platform for Gladding to reframe her breach as council's failure.

"QLDC claims that the reference to wide body jets at Wanaka airport was just 'an error'" (line 18) - QLDC's position is presented as "claims" while Gladding's contrary view is given extensive space as though it were established fact.

**Findings:**

This article constitutes a clear breach of Principle 1. While the article reports the investigation's findings, it fails to provide fair balance by giving extensive platform to Gladding's justifications and criticisms without any right of reply to those criticized (QLDC management, other councillors) or balancing perspectives on the seriousness of Code of Conduct breaches. The article effectively undermines the investigation's findings by allowing the subject of an adverse finding to dominate the narrative without challenge or balance.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The article systematically fails to distinguish between factual information and opinion/interpretation:

**Fact vs. Opinion/Characterization Confusion:**

1. **"Scathing investigation report"** (line 7) - This is editorial characterization presented as fact in the opening sentence. What makes it "scathing"? This is opinion masquerading as description.

2. **"QLDC claims that the reference to wide body jets at Wanaka airport was just 'an error'"** (line 18) - The word "claims" suggests doubt about QLDC's position, framing it as disputed or questionable rather than as their factual statement. This is editorializing through word choice.

3. **"Councillor Gladding has told Crux today that council managers plan to avoid having the investigation discussed at Thursday's council meeting"** (lines 20-21) - This presents Gladding's allegation as though it were fact ("plan to avoid") rather than clearly labeling it as her interpretation or claim. The factual statement would be: "Gladding alleges that..." or "Gladding claims that..."

4. **"Nothing leads me to believe that the wide body jets reference was a mistake"** (line 16) - Gladding's opinion is presented without any factual foundation or counter-analysis. The article provides no expert review, no examination of the consultant's methodology, no verification of her interpretation.

**Lack of Clear Identification:**

The article is presented as straight news reporting with a standard byline ("by Peter Newport - Aug 31, 2020"). However, the article contains substantial editorial framing and characterization that is not clearly identified as such:

- The opening word "scathing" is editorial judgment
- The selection and emphasis given to Gladding's justifications over the investigation's findings reflects editorial positioning
- The minimization of the previous NZMC complaint ("partially upheld") reflects editorial framing
- The presentation of Gladding's allegations against council managers without verification or balancing response

**Factual Foundation:**

Many claims lack proper factual foundation:
- Gladding's assertion that managers "plan to avoid having the investigation discussed" - no evidence provided, no verification attempted, no response from managers
- Gladding's analysis that "we had clearly stated to the public that wide body jets were not being considered for Wanaka" - no documentation of these public statements provided
- The characterization of the investigation as "scathing" - no explanation of what makes it scathing versus a standard investigation finding

**Evidence:**

"A scathing investigation report into the leak to Crux by Councillor Niki Gladding" (line 7) - Editorial characterization in the opening sentence, not clearly labeled as opinion.

"QLDC claims that the reference to wide body jets at Wanaka airport was just 'an error'" (line 18) - Word choice ("claims") editorializes rather than neutrally presenting fact.

"My concern around that was that we had clearly stated to the public that wide body jets were not being considered for Wanaka." (line 17) - Gladding's characterization of what was "clearly stated" is not verified with actual public statements or documentation.

"The complaint was partially upheld and centred on whether Crux had given QLDC sufficient right of reply in our coverage." (line 18) - This minimizing characterization of Crux's own breach is presented as factual summary without providing the actual findings.

**Findings:**

The article breaches Principle 4 by failing to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion/characterization. The article uses editorial language ("scathing," "claims") that shapes reader interpretation without being clearly labeled as opinion. More significantly, it presents Gladding's allegations and interpretations as though they were facts without proper verification or balancing perspectives. The article should have clearly distinguished between the factual findings of the investigation and Gladding's opinions about those findings.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Acceptable with Concerns

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "Crux leak: QLDC investigation finds Niki Gladding guilty of 'serious breach.'"

**Accuracy Assessment:**

The headline is technically accurate - an investigation did find Gladding guilty of a "serious breach." The use of quotation marks around "serious breach" properly indicates this is quoted language from the investigation report.

**Concerns:**

However, the headline's framing presents concerns:

1. **"Crux leak"** - This phrasing could be interpreted as suggesting Crux was the source of a leak, when in fact Crux was the recipient of leaked information from Gladding. A clearer headline would be "Leak to Crux" or "Councillor's leak to Crux."

2. **Emphasis**: The headline emphasizes the investigation's adverse finding, which is the newsworthy fact. However, the article's content substantially undermines that finding by providing extensive platform to Gladding's justifications. There is a disconnect between the headline's emphasis and the article's actual framing.

**Substance Reflection:**

The headline does reflect the key factual element - that an investigation found a serious breach. However, it does not signal that the article will primarily function as a platform for Gladding to justify and defend her conduct. A more accurate headline reflecting the article's actual content might be: "Gladding found guilty of 'serious breach' but defends leak as justified" or "Gladding 'guilty of serious breach' in leak to Crux but expresses no regret."

**Evidence:**

Headline: "Crux leak: QLDC investigation finds Niki Gladding guilty of 'serious breach.'" (line 2)

The headline accurately captures the investigation's finding but the ambiguous phrasing "Crux leak" could mislead readers about who was leaking to whom.

**Findings:**

The headline does not constitute a clear breach of Principle 6, as it is technically accurate and uses proper attribution (quotation marks) for the characterization "serious breach." However, the ambiguous phrasing "Crux leak" and the disconnect between the headline's emphasis (adverse finding) and the article's framing (Gladding's justifications) raise concerns about whether the headline fairly conveys the substance of the article.

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

This article presents a significant conflict of interest that is inadequately disclosed and managed.

**The Conflict:**

Crux is reporting on an investigation into a leak **to Crux itself**. The article is about:
1. An investigation finding that Gladding breached Code of Conduct by leaking to Crux
2. A previous NZMC complaint by QLDC against Crux about the coverage of that leaked information
3. Crux's own conduct in the original "wide body jets" story that prompted the leak

Crux is simultaneously:
- The beneficiary of the leak (received exclusive information)
- The subject of investigation-related controversy (QLDC's NZMC complaint)
- The reporter on the investigation findings
- The platform for the leaker's justifications

**Disclosure Issues:**

While the article does mention the NZMC complaint ("QLDC claims that the reference to wide body jets at Wanaka airport was just 'an error' and made a comprehensive complaint to the NZ Media Council against Crux in connection with the matter. The complaint was partially upheld" - line 18), this disclosure is inadequate because:

1. **Minimization**: The phrase "partially upheld" minimizes the seriousness without explaining what breaches were found
2. **Context**: The disclosure is buried mid-article rather than prominently stated at the beginning
3. **Incomplete**: The article does not disclose that Crux was denied access to official documents (line 19) or explain why QLDC might have been justified in that denial
4. **No Recusal**: There is no indication that Crux considered whether reporting on an investigation into a leak to itself creates inherent conflict

**Editorial Independence Concerns:**

The article's treatment raises questions about editorial independence:

1. **Favorable Coverage of Source**: Gladding, who provided Crux with exclusive leaked information, receives highly favorable coverage - extensive platform to justify her conduct, minimal critical analysis, no balancing perspectives from those she harmed

2. **Defensive Framing**: The article frames the leak as justified ("still felt the move was justified" - line 14) and criticizes QLDC for allegedly planning to "avoid having the investigation discussed" (line 21), effectively defending both Gladding and Crux's own controversial coverage

3. **Self-Interest**: Crux has a clear interest in portraying Gladding's leak as justified and in minimizing the previous NZMC finding against its coverage. The article's framing serves that interest.

**Evidence:**

"Speaking to Crux this afternoon, after the release of the investigation report" (line 14) - Crux actively sought out Gladding for her response, providing her platform to justify the leak to Crux.

"The complaint was partially upheld and centred on whether Crux had given QLDC sufficient right of reply in our coverage." (line 18) - This minimizing disclosure of Crux's own breach is the only reference to Crux's conflict of interest.

"Crux wrote to QLDC twice seeking information about the 'wide body jets' Wanaka reference but was denied access to official documents." (line 19) - This presents Crux as the aggrieved party ("denied access") without acknowledging that QLDC may have had valid reasons for denying access to confidential documents, or that Crux's receipt of leaked confidential information may have been problematic.

"Councillor Gladding is disappointed the QLDC has not accepted the investigator's recommendation that the incident be used as a chance for QLDC to look at its own policies around the sharing of information." (lines 20-21) - The article gives platform to criticism of QLDC without any balancing response, serving Crux's interest in deflecting from the breach findings.

**Findings:**

This article constitutes a breach of Principle 10. Crux is reporting on an investigation into a leak to itself and a related NZMC complaint against itself while failing to adequately disclose and manage the inherent conflicts of interest. The article should have:
1. Prominently disclosed at the beginning that this investigation concerns a leak to Crux and related NZMC findings against Crux's coverage
2. Provided full details of what the NZMC found rather than minimizing it as "partially upheld"
3. Considered whether independent reporting by another outlet would better serve public interest
4. Avoided providing favorable platform to the source (Gladding) who provided Crux with leaked information
5. Sought balancing comment from QLDC officials to avoid appearance of defensive, self-interested coverage

The substantial platform given to Gladding's justifications, combined with inadequate disclosure of Crux's conflicts, creates appearance that editorial independence has been compromised by self-interest.

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**

The article is presented as straight news reporting with a standard byline ("by Peter Newport - Aug 31, 2020") and news article format. There is no label such as "Opinion," "Analysis," or "Commentary" that would signal this is anything other than news reporting.

However, the article contains substantial editorial framing and characterization:
- "Scathing investigation report" (line 7) - editorial judgment
- Emphasis on Gladding's justifications over investigation findings
- Minimization of NZMC complaint against Crux as "partially upheld"
- Framing of QLDC as making "claims" (line 18) versus presenting facts

**Foundation of Fact:**

Even if treated as opinion or analysis content, the article has weaknesses in factual foundation:
- Gladding's allegation that managers plan to "avoid having the investigation discussed" is not verified
- The characterization of the investigation as "scathing" is not supported with specific findings
- The minimization of the previous NZMC complaint lacks detail about what was actually found

**Balance Requirement:**

Principle 5 notes "with comment and opinion balance is not essential." However, this article is not clearly labeled as opinion. It presents in news format while containing editorial framing and one-sided perspective. The lack of balance might be acceptable for a clearly-labeled opinion piece but is problematic for what appears to be news content.

**Evidence:**

The article header shows: "by Peter Newport - Aug 31, 2020" (line 3) - standard news byline format, not opinion column identification.

"A scathing investigation report" (line 7) - editorial characterization in opening sentence of what appears to be news article.

**Findings:**

If this article were clearly labeled as analysis or commentary, the extensive quotation of Gladding and editorial framing might be more acceptable. However, because it presents in news format without clear identification as opinion content, it cannot claim the protection of Principle 5. This constitutes a potential breach - the article should have been clearly labeled if it was intended as analysis rather than straight news reporting, or it should have maintained news standards of balance and factual presentation.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The article does not raise privacy concerns. The individuals named (Niki Gladding, council officials by title) are public officials engaged in public roles. The matter discussed - a Code of Conduct investigation - relates to public governance and is clearly a matter of public interest and public record.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical or mental disability. While it features a female councillor, gender is not gratuitously emphasized or made relevant to the coverage.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Potential Issue

**Analysis:**

The article is reporting on a leak of confidential information. While Crux is not itself bound by QLDC's confidentiality requirements, the article's treatment raises ethical questions:

The article provides extensive platform for Gladding to justify her breach of confidentiality ("I didn't want to hang on to that knowledge myself" - line 25) without any discussion of why confidentiality requirements exist for councillors or the harm caused by breaching them.

The article mentions that "Crux wrote to QLDC twice seeking information about the 'wide body jets' Wanaka reference but was denied access to official documents" (line 19). This framing suggests QLDC was being unreasonable, when in fact they may have been properly protecting confidential information that Gladding then improperly leaked.

However, this does not constitute a breach of Principle 8, which concerns Crux's obligations to protect its own confidential sources. Gladding was not a confidential source - she was identified. The issue is one of Crux potentially encouraging or benefiting from breach of others' confidentiality obligations, which relates more to Principle 10 (conflicts of interest).

**Findings:**
No direct breach of Principle 8, though the treatment of confidentiality issues relates to the Principle 10 breach identified above.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. The article is based on a publicly released investigation report and an interview with Gladding.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text provided does not include details about photographs or graphics. Cannot assess from available information.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The article fails to provide fair balance by giving extensive platform to Gladding's justifications and criticisms without any right of reply to those criticized (QLDC management, other councillors, the mayor). The article contains inaccuracies in its characterization of the previous NZMC complaint as merely "partially upheld" without explaining what was actually found. Claims by Gladding (that managers plan to avoid discussion) are presented without verification.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The article fails to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion/characterization. Editorial language ("scathing," "claims") shapes reader interpretation without being clearly labeled as opinion. Gladding's allegations and interpretations are presented as fact without proper verification.

3. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - BREACH**: Crux is reporting on an investigation into a leak to itself and related NZMC findings against itself while failing to adequately disclose and manage inherent conflicts of interest. The article provides favorable platform to Gladding (who leaked to Crux) while minimizing Crux's own previous breach and failing to seek balancing comment from QLDC.

4. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion or analysis content despite containing substantial editorial framing and characterization. It presents in news format while functioning partly as opinion/commentary.

5. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - ACCEPTABLE WITH CONCERNS**: The headline is technically accurate but uses ambiguous phrasing ("Crux leak") that could mislead readers about who was leaking to whom. There is a disconnect between the headline's emphasis (adverse finding) and the article's framing (Gladding's justifications).

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This article demonstrates concerning patterns:

1. **Self-Interest Over Public Interest**: The article serves Crux's interests by:
   - Providing favorable coverage to the source (Gladding) who leaked to Crux
   - Minimizing the previous NZMC finding against Crux's coverage
   - Framing QLDC as obstructive ("denied access") rather than properly protecting confidential information
   - Failing to seek balancing perspectives from those criticized

2. **Undermining Accountability**: Despite reporting that an investigation found a "serious breach," the article's framing undermines the finding by:
   - Allowing the subject of the adverse finding to dominate the narrative
   - Presenting her justifications extensively without challenge
   - Providing no voice to those harmed by the breach
   - Failing to explore why Code of Conduct exists or the seriousness of breaches

3. **Opinion as Fact**: Throughout the article, editorial characterizations ("scathing," "claims") and Gladding's opinions are presented as though they were facts without proper verification or balancing perspectives.

4. **Inadequate Disclosure**: While the article mentions the NZMC complaint against Crux, it minimizes this as "partially upheld" without explaining what was actually found wrong with Crux's coverage. This inadequate disclosure of conflicts of interest undermines transparency.

5. **Absence of Right of Reply**: Multiple parties are criticized or affected (QLDC management allegedly planning to avoid discussion, other councillors who experienced "issues," QLDC officials characterized as making "claims") without any being given opportunity to respond.

---

**Conflict of Interest Context:**

This article's fundamental problem is that Crux is reporting on its own involvement in a controversy. Specifically:

1. **Direct Involvement**: Gladding leaked confidential information **to Crux**
2. **Previous Breach**: QLDC complained to NZMC about **Crux's coverage** of that leaked information
3. **NZMC Finding**: The complaint was upheld (at least partially) against **Crux**
4. **Current Story**: Crux is now reporting on the investigation into the leak **to Crux**

This creates multiple conflicts:
- Crux has interest in portraying the leak as justified (defending its source)
- Crux has interest in minimizing the NZMC finding against its own coverage
- Crux has interest in portraying QLDC negatively (as the party that complained about Crux)
- Crux has interest in avoiding balanced coverage that might validate QLDC's original complaint

The article's one-sided coverage, favorable treatment of Gladding, minimization of NZMC findings, and lack of balancing QLDC perspectives all serve these conflicts of interest rather than the public interest in balanced, accurate reporting.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are strong grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The article fails to give fair voice to opposition views or those criticized. Specific grounds:
   - No right of reply given to QLDC management regarding Gladding's allegation they plan to "avoid having the investigation discussed"
   - No opportunity for mayor or council leadership to respond to governance issues raised
   - No perspectives from other councillors affected by Gladding's breach
   - No balancing views on the seriousness of Code of Conduct breaches
   - Inaccurate characterization of previous NZMC complaint as merely "partially upheld" without details
   - Unverified claims presented as fact

2. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: Crux failed to adequately disclose and manage conflicts of interest when reporting on investigation into leak to itself. Specific grounds:
   - Inadequate disclosure of Crux's own involvement (leak was to Crux, NZMC complaint was against Crux)
   - Minimization of NZMC findings against Crux as "partially upheld" without details
   - Favorable platform given to source (Gladding) who leaked to Crux
   - No balancing comment from QLDC officials
   - Appearance that editorial independence compromised by self-interest

3. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The article fails to clearly distinguish between factual information and opinion. Specific grounds:
   - Editorial characterizations ("scathing") presented as fact in news article
   - Gladding's allegations ("managers plan to avoid") presented as fact without verification
   - Word choice ("claims") editorializes QLDC's position
   - Article not clearly labeled as analysis despite containing substantial opinion elements

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 5 - Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion content despite containing substantial editorial framing.

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Lack of Balance - Direct Criticism Without Right of Reply:**
   - "Councillor Gladding has told Crux today that council managers plan to avoid having the investigation discussed at Thursday's council meeting" (lines 20-21) - Serious allegation of managerial misconduct with no verification or right of reply
   - "I understand that it did cause an issue for other councillors" (line 25) - Acknowledgment of harm to other councillors who are not given voice
   - Approximately 60% of article consists of Gladding's quotes defending her breach, with no balancing perspectives

2. **Conflicts of Interest - Inadequate Disclosure:**
   - "The complaint was partially upheld and centred on whether Crux had given QLDC sufficient right of reply in our coverage." (line 18) - Minimization of Crux's own breach without details
   - "Crux wrote to QLDC twice seeking information about the 'wide body jets' Wanaka reference but was denied access to official documents." (line 19) - Frames Crux as aggrieved party without acknowledging documents may have been properly confidential
   - Extensive favorable coverage of Gladding who leaked to Crux: "still felt the move was justified" (line 14)

3. **Opinion Presented as Fact:**
   - "A scathing investigation report" (line 7) - Editorial characterization in news article opening
   - "QLDC claims that the reference to wide body jets at Wanaka airport was just 'an error'" (line 18) - Word "claims" suggests doubt, editorializing
   - "managers plan to avoid having the investigation discussed" (line 21) - Allegation presented as fact without verification

4. **Inaccuracy:**
   - "The complaint was partially upheld" (line 18) - Minimizes breach without explaining what was actually found against Crux's coverage

---

**Required Actions per NZMC Procedure:**

**Note on Timing:**
This article was published August 31, 2020. The normal one-month deadline for complaints has long passed. Any complaint would require requesting extension from NZMC Chair under procedure paragraph 16, explaining:
- The reasons for the delay (article being reviewed as part of broader pattern analysis)
- The length of delay (over 5 years)
- That this is retrospective pattern analysis, not contemporaneous complaint

Given this timing issue, this review is primarily useful for:
1. **Pattern Documentation**: Establishing historical pattern of NZMC breaches by Crux
2. **Context for Current Complaints**: Supporting evidence for ongoing or recent complaints
3. **Publisher Discussion**: Raising broader concerns about editorial practices with Crux
4. **Future Reference**: Informing approach to any future similar situations

**If Pursuing Despite Timing Issues:**

**Step 1 - Complaint to Publisher (Crux):**
- **Method**: Written complaint clearly marked as complaint to publisher
- **Content**: Should cite specific principle breaches and request:
  - Acknowledgment of conflicts of interest in reporting on leak to itself
  - Correction to provide full details of what NZMC found in previous complaint
  - Acknowledgment that article failed to provide balance or right of reply
  - Publication of QLDC's perspective on the investigation and Gladding's conduct

**Step 2 - Escalation to NZMC (if necessary):**
- **Timing**: If no response within 10 working days, or if response is unsatisfactory
- **Method**: Online complaint form at NZMC website
- **Special Request**: Request Chair extension of time limits under procedure paragraph 16
- **Requirements**:
  - State principles breached (Principles 1, 4, 10, and potentially 5)
  - Provide article link and copy
  - Explain delay and request time extension
  - Include any complaint to publisher and their response
  - Provide key points in 500 words
  - Provide proper name
  - Sign waiver

**Step 3 - Supporting Documentation to Gather:**
- Copy of article as published (archived version)
- Copy of previous NZMC ruling on QLDC complaint against Crux (to verify how "partially upheld" characterization was misleading)
- Copy of investigation report finding "serious breach" (if publicly available)
- Council records of Code of Conduct policies and breach procedures
- Any other Crux articles from same period showing pattern of conflicts of interest

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of decision with fair prominence

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Correction/Retraction**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Article failed to adequately disclose and manage conflicts of interest
   - Article failed to provide balance or right of reply to those criticized
   - Previous NZMC complaint characterization was incomplete/misleading
   - Gladding's allegations should have been verified or clearly labeled as unverified

4. **Process Improvements**: Request Crux establish clear editorial policies for:
   - Managing conflicts of interest when reporting on stories involving Crux
   - Mandatory recusal or independent reporting when Crux is subject of story
   - Full disclosure of previous NZMC findings
   - Mandatory right of reply when individuals or organizations are criticized
   - Clear labeling of opinion vs. news content

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Historical Pattern**: This 2020 article is valuable for establishing pattern of:
   - Conflicts of interest in Crux's coverage of QLDC matters

**Conclusion:**

This article represents a significant failure of journalistic standards, particularly regarding conflicts of interest and balance. Crux's reporting on an investigation into a leak to itself, while minimizing its own previous NZMC breach and providing extensive favorable platform to the leaker without balancing perspectives, constitutes multiple violations of NZMC principles.

The article's fundamental problem is the conflict between Crux's self-interest (defending its source, minimizing its own breach, portraying QLDC negatively) and the public interest in balanced, accurate reporting on governance accountability. This conflict was inadequately disclosed and poorly managed, undermining editorial independence and public trust.

While the timing (5+ years) creates significant barriers to formal complaint, this review documents an important pattern of conflicts of interest and balance failures in Crux's coverage of QLDC matters, particularly involving Councillor Gladding. This pattern provides valuable context for understanding and addressing current concerns about Crux's editorial standards and accountability.
