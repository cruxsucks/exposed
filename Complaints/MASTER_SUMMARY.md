- **Frequency:** 14 of 16 P4 breaches
- **Pattern:** Opinions, characterizations, judgments presented as established facts

- **Impact:** Readers misled about what is fact vs. opinion

### 3. Loaded Language in Headlines (P6)
- **Frequency:** 5 of 11 P6 breaches
- **Pattern:** Characterizations rather than neutral descriptions
- **Examples:** "Cheerleader," "resorts to," "attack," "mystery"
- **Impact:** Headlines create false impressions even if article more balanced

### 4. Undisclosed Electoral Context (P10)
- **Frequency:** 7 of 15 P10 breaches
- **Pattern:** Systematic failure to disclose electoral implications
- **Impact:** Voters unaware of Crux's conflicts and interests

## Recommended Complaint Strategy

### Option A: Single Comprehensive Complaint (All Principles)
**Select 3-4 strongest articles demonstrating pattern across all principles**

**Recommended Articles:**
1. **250920 - John Glover** (P1, P4, P5, P6, P10)
2. **250928 - Lewers Launch** (P1, P4, P6, P10)
3. **251001 - Personal Attacks** (P1, P4, P6, P10)

**Advantages:**
- Shows systematic pattern across multiple principles
- Demonstrates repeated breaches despite previous NZMC findings
- Concentrated in final 3 weeks of election (maximum impact)

**Disadvantages:**
- Complex complaint may be harder to adjudicate
- Risk of some breaches being dismissed while others upheld

---

### Option B: Separate Complaints by Principle (Recommended)
**File 4 separate complaints, each focused on one principle with 3-5 strongest examples**

#### Complaint 1: P1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance)
**Focus:** No right of reply during election period

**Recommended Articles:**
1. **250920 - John Glover** (unverified legal claims, hearsay, 21 days before election)
2. **250922 - Lisa Guy CEO** (stenography, no independent verification)
3. **250928 - Lewers Launch** (no right of reply, 13 days before election)
4. **251001 - Personal Attacks** (methodology gaps, 10 days before election)

**Strength:** Clear pattern of denying right of reply, concentrated in election period

---

#### Complaint 2: P4 (Comment and Fact)
**Focus:** Opinion presented as fact, stenography

**Recommended Articles:**
1. **250916 - Cheerleader** (loaded characterization in headline)
2. **250920 - John Glover** (opinion/speculation as news)
3. **250922 - Lisa Guy CEO** (stenography pattern)
4. **251001 - Personal Attacks** ("data shows" implies objectivity for opinion)

**Strength:** Clear examples of opinion as fact, previous NZMC findings on same issue

---

#### Complaint 3: P6 (Headlines)
**Focus:** Loaded language, speculation as certainty

**Recommended Articles:**
1. **250916 - Cheerleader** (clearest example: "cheerleader" loaded term)
2. **250922 - Lisa Guy CEO** (personal over substantive)
3. **251001 - Personal Attacks** ("data shows" false objectivity)

**Strength:** Clear loaded language, previous NZMC findings on headlines

---

**Focus:** Electoral context undisclosed, campaign platforms

**Recommended Articles:**
1. **250903 - Niki Gladding** (campaign platform without disclosure)
2. **250920 - John Glover** (challenger's attack letter as news)
3. **250928 - Lewers Launch** (candidate letter as news, 13 days before election)
4. **250930 FB - Glyn Lewers** (meta-conflict, adversarial relationship)

**Strength:** Clear pattern of providing campaign platforms without disclosure
