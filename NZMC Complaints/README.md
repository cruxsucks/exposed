**Media Council Warnings:**
- Article mixed comment and fact, blurred the line
- **"Strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future"**
- Flippant Facebook comment "likely to provoke readers"
- Maintain professional standards on social media

---

**Upheld Under:** Principles 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance), 4 (Comment and Fact), 6 (Headlines)

**Key Failures:**

- Speculative opinion presented as factual report
- Failed to report QAC's response that contradicted narrative
- Inaccurate and unfair captions

**Critical Finding:**

---

### Case 3012 - March 2021 - NOT UPHELD
**Complainant:** Jendi Paterson (QLDC consultant)
**Article:** "You be the judge: Is QLDC telling the truth over how it spends your money?" (Jan 15, 2021)

**Media Council Observations:**
- Legitimate public interest story about council spending
- QLDC's own investigation confirmed procurement failures
- Some reporting was "sloppy" (inaccurate assumptions about earnings)
- Advised to improve captions and ensure corrections across entire article series

---

### Case 3356 - December 2022 - **UPHELD**
**Complainant:** Andrew Tipene (engineer/consultant)
**Article:** "QLDC engineer writes own $448,000 consulting deal" (Aug 10, 2022)
**Upheld Under:** Principles 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance) & 6 (Headlines)

**Key Failures:**
- Should have given Tipene opportunity to comment before publication
- Claim couldn't find contact details was "clearly wrong" - had his email
- **"Reliance only on social media seems a paltry effort"**
- Inaccurate headline and characterization of "Offer of Service" as completed contract

**Strongest Media Council Reprimand:**
- **"Disappointed by Crux's conduct"**

- Council reminded: **"Even if other matters it is pursuing are verifiable and important that does not detract from its obligations in relation to other stories it publishes"**
- Noted this was **at least the 5th complaint from QLDC, its subsidiaries, or contractors**

---

## Crux's Defense Pattern

Crux consistently argues:
- Describes itself as doing "advocacy journalism"
- Claims to be "consistently opinionated in favour of the community"
- Peter Newport's tone reflects his own views
- Cites Media Council preamble allowing "forthright stances and advocacy journalism"
- Claims to be "only local media platform that holds power to account in Southern Lakes"

**Media Council's Response:**
- Acknowledges advocacy journalism is valid genre
- **BUT:** "standards of ethical journalism" must still be maintained
- Facts must be accurate even in opinion pieces
- Clear labeling required when mixing fact and opinion
- Cannot use advocacy journalism as excuse for inaccuracy or unfairness

---

## Key Statistics

- **Total Complaints:** 5 (2020-2022)
- **Upheld:** 3 (60%)
- **Not Upheld:** 2 (40%)
- **Pattern:** At least 5 complaints from QLDC, its subsidiaries, or contractors
- **Most Common Breach:** Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance) - alleged in 100% of cases
- **Second Most Common:** Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - alleged in 80% of cases

---

## Important Context for New Complaints

### Established Patterns
The Media Council has found Crux breached principles in 60% of cases, with consistent issues around:
- Fact/opinion distinction
- Inadequate right of reply
- Inaccurate headlines
- Unprofessional conduct

### Media Council's Position
- Recognizes Crux performs legitimate public interest reporting
- Acknowledges Crux's investigations have resulted in QLDC admitting failures
- Recognizes vital role in holding local government accountable
- **BUT** requires maintenance of ethical journalism standards regardless of advocacy role

### Privacy Defenses Don't Succeed
Privacy complaints (Principle 2) have not been upheld - public interest in council spending and public officials' conduct overrides privacy concerns

### Complaint Procedure Requirements
1. Must complain to publisher first within 1 month of publication
2. Then to Media Council within 20 working days if unsatisfied
3. Sign waiver that this is only form of formal action
4. Identify specific Principles breached
5. Maximum 500 words for key complaint points
