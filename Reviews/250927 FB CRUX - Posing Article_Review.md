# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Facebook Post - Councillor Lisa Guy Rationale Conflict of Interest
**Publication:** Crux (Facebook)
**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Author:** Crux (organizational account)
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This Facebook post consists of Crux's responses to a community member's criticism of their reporting on Councillor Lisa Guy during an election period. The responses demonstrate multiple breaches of NZMC principles, including unfair characterization of critics, aggressive defensive posturing, failure to distinguish fact from opinion, and inappropriate attacks on both a community member and Councillor Niki Gladding. The content reveals concerning patterns of behavior including demanding proof while providing none themselves, making unsubstantiated claims about subjects' character and motives, and using their platform to attack critics rather than engage constructively.

---

## Article Summary
The Facebook post begins with Crux's summary of their reporting on Lisa Guy (lines 1-3), followed by a comment from Christina Dawson expressing skepticism about Crux's coverage and support for Lisa Guy (lines 6-14). Crux then responds multiple times to Dawson with:

- Claims that they employed "NZ's top media barrister Robert Stewart KC" to verify their facts (line 17)
- Attacks on Lisa Guy's character, describing "nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux)" (line 17)
- Accusations that Dawson's criticism has "damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy" (line 17)
- Repeated demands that Dawson provide specific facts or assumptions that are wrong (lines 19-31)
- Assertions about QLDC's trust rating and lies (line 20)
- Self-justification comparing themselves to police "catching criminals" (line 17)

Other community members' comments expressing concerns about corruption and council trustworthiness are also included (lines 34-51).

---

## Context Considerations
Per ReviewContext.MD, this occurs during the Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections. Crux is a local news site reporting on QLDC matters with a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council.

The electoral context is critical: this post involves active candidates (Lisa Guy seeking re-election, and mentions of Stephen Brent as a 2025 candidate). The post demonstrates Crux's response pattern to criticism during an election period, which affects public perception of both candidates and the publication's credibility.

The reference to Christina Dawson indicates she is a community member who has engaged with QLDC processes (UIV hearings in Arrowtown) and has now publicly questioned Crux's reporting methods and conclusions.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**

The post contains several unsubstantiated claims presented as fact:

1. "Lisa has tried hard to present a 'folksy and innocent' image to the community - but her recent nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux), supported by mayor Lewers, tell an entirely different story." (line 17) - No evidence provided for "nasty, vicious attacks," no specifics given, no documentation cited. This is character assassination presented as fact.

2. "QLDC love to present us as being like a dog with a bone - obsessive" (line 17) - Attribution to "QLDC" as a whole without specific source or quote.

3. "QLDC, in spite of our reporting, has never lied to us and does not deserve the 17% - or more accurately 4% - trust rating" (line 20) - Two different trust ratings given without source or clarification of which survey, when conducted, or what the accurate figure is.

4. "We have no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness" (line 20) - Self-assessment presented as fact when the very exchange demonstrates agenda-driven defensive behavior.

5. Employment of "NZ's top media barrister Robert Stewart KC" (line 17) - While potentially verifiable, the characterization as "NZ's top media barrister" is opinion, not fact. More importantly, legal review for defamation risk is not the same as journalistic verification of accuracy.

**Fairness Issues:**

The post is fundamentally unfair in multiple ways:

1. **Attacking a Community Member**: Christina Dawson, a private citizen offering her perspective, is told her "empty criticism has damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy" (line 17). This is an inappropriate use of a media platform to intimidate and silence criticism.

2. **Character Attacks on Lisa Guy**: Describing her as presenting a "folksy and innocent image" while engaging in "nasty, vicious attacks" (line 17) is character assassination without supporting evidence. Even if Guy has criticized Crux, characterizing this as "nasty" and "vicious" is subjective editorializing designed to damage her reputation.

3. **Burden Shifting**: Crux demands Christina provide proof of errors ("please start listing the assumptions," "we are happy to start with just one wrong fact or assumption") while simultaneously making serious character allegations without providing any evidence themselves. This double standard is fundamentally unfair.

4. **Aggressive Posturing**: The repeated, insistent demands for Christina to identify specific errors (lines 22, 25, 28, 31) creates an intimidating, adversarial dynamic inappropriate for a media organization engaging with community feedback.

5. **Attacks on Niki Gladding**: The mention of Guy's "nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux)" (line 17) drags another councillor into the dispute without context or her ability to respond. This is unfair to Gladding, who is not party to this exchange.

**Balance Issues:**

The post lacks balance in several ways:

1. No acknowledgment that Christina's concerns might have any validity
2. No recognition that reasonable people might interpret the Lisa Guy situation differently
3. No consideration that demanding proof from critics while providing none themselves is hypocritical
4. No balanced presentation of the underlying issues about Lisa Guy's situation
5. Entirely defensive and self-justifying without self-reflection

**Evidence:**

"Lisa has tried hard to present a 'folksy and innocent' image to the community - but her recent nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux), supported by mayor Lewers, tell an entirely different story." (line 17) - Serious character attack without any supporting evidence, quotes, or specific examples.

"With respect - we think your empty criticism has damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy." (line 17) - Attacking a community member for expressing her views, attempting to silence criticism through intimidation.

"Imagine the police getting criticised for being like a 'dog with a bone' in catching criminals - that's what the community want from the police and from good journalism." (line 17) - False equivalence comparing journalism to criminal investigation, self-aggrandizing comparison lacking humility.

"So you must be saying that the QLDC, in spite of our reporting, has never lied to us and does not deserve the 17% - or more accurately 4% - trust rating in their own community survey?" (line 20) - Logical fallacy putting words in Christina's mouth, demanding she defend positions she never took.

**Findings:**

This post constitutes a clear breach of Principle 1. Rather than engaging fairly with legitimate community criticism, Crux uses their platform to attack both the critic (Christina Dawson) and their subject (Lisa Guy) with unsubstantiated character allegations. The aggressive, demanding tone and refusal to acknowledge any possibility of their own error demonstrates a fundamental failure of fairness. The burden-shifting (demanding proof while providing none) and character attacks (describing Guy as "nasty" and "vicious" without evidence) fall well below acceptable journalistic standards.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The post systematically fails to distinguish between factual claims and Crux's opinions and interpretations:

**Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**

1. "Lisa has tried hard to present a 'folksy and innocent' image" (line 17) - Opinion about Lisa's intent and presentation style, stated as fact

2. "Her recent nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux)" (line 17) - Opinion characterization ("nasty," "vicious") presented as fact; no evidence that attacks occurred, much less that they were "nasty" or "vicious"

3. "Your empty criticism has damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy" (line 17) - Opinion about the impact of Christina's comments, presented as fact

4. "QLDC love to present us as being like a dog with a bone - obsessive" (line 17) - Opinion about QLDC's view, presented as fact without attribution

5. "That's what the community want from the police and from good journalism" (line 17) - Opinion about community desires, presented as fact without survey or evidence

6. "She is deliberately blurring and confusing the issues around her ownership of Rationale" (line 17) - Opinion about Lisa's intent ("deliberately"), presented as fact; assumes bad faith without evidence

**Lack of Clear Identification:**

The post is on Crux's Facebook page, which might be understood to contain organizational opinions. However, the content is presented as factual reporting and defense of factual reporting, not clearly identified as opinion or editorial commentary. The aggressive tone and character attacks go beyond what would be acceptable even in clearly-labeled opinion content.

**Factual Foundation:**

Many claims completely lack factual foundation:

1. "Nasty, vicious attacks" - No examples given, no quotes provided, no dates or contexts specified
2. "Supported by mayor Lewers" - No evidence of mayor's support for alleged attacks
3. Trust rating "17% - or more accurately 4%" - No source cited, two different figures given with no explanation
4. "QLDC has never lied to us" - Sarcastic framing implying they have lied, but no specific lies identified
5. Employment of Robert Stewart KC - While possibly true, no verification provided (case number, invoice, letter of engagement)

**Evidence:**

"We employed NZ's top media barrister Robert Stewart KC to check through public records to ensure our analysis was 100% factual and correct re Lisa's connection with Rationale." (line 17) - Multiple problems: "NZ's top" is opinion; "100% factual and correct" is unverifiable absolute claim; legal review for defamation risk ≠ journalistic accuracy verification.

"Lisa has tried hard to present a 'folksy and innocent' image to the community - but her recent nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux), supported by mayor Lewers, tell an entirely different story." (line 17) - Entirely opinion-based character assessment with no factual foundation, presented as revealing truth.

"We have no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness" (line 20) - Self-assessment presented as fact when the behavior in the post contradicts this claim.

"We think your empty criticism has damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy" (line 17) - At least uses "we think," but the characterization as "empty" is opinion stated as fact.

**Findings:**

The post breaches Principle 4 by presenting opinions, characterizations, and unverified claims as factual statements. The serious character allegations against Lisa Guy ("nasty, vicious attacks") and Christina Dawson ("empty criticism has damaged") are opinions presented as facts without supporting evidence. The post should clearly distinguish between verified facts (e.g., "we commissioned legal review by Robert Stewart KC" with documentation) and opinions (e.g., "we believe Lisa Guy's explanations are inconsistent"). Instead, it blurs these distinctions throughout, presenting subjective judgments as established truth.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**

The content appears on Crux's Facebook page, which could be understood as a platform for organizational commentary. However, Facebook posts from a news organization's official page are not automatically understood as opinion - they often share news content, reporting, and factual updates.

This post is not clearly labeled as opinion, editorial, or commentary. It's presented as the organization's factual defense of its reporting, not as opinion content. The aggressive tone and character attacks suggest this goes beyond what would be acceptable even in clearly-labeled opinion.

**Foundation of Fact:**

Even if treated as opinion content, the post has serious weaknesses in factual foundation:

1. No evidence provided for "nasty, vicious attacks" by Lisa Guy
2. No documentation of Robert Stewart KC's engagement or findings
3. Conflicting trust rating figures (17% vs 4%) without source
4. No specific examples of QLDC lies alleged in sarcastic question
5. No evidence that Christina's criticism "damaged" anyone

**Professional Standards:**

Even opinion content should meet professional standards. This post fails by:
- Attacking a private citizen for expressing her views
- Making serious character allegations without evidence
- Using intimidation tactics (repeated demands for proof)
- Engaging in ad hominem attacks rather than substantive response
- Demonstrating defensiveness rather than accountability

**Evidence:**

The post format and presentation suggest organizational response to criticism, not clearly-identified opinion. It's on the official Crux Facebook page, attributed to "Crux" (not an individual columnist), and presented as defense of their factual reporting.

The repeated demands "please start listing the assumptions," "we are happy to start with just one wrong fact or assumption," "from the article please - that's what you are complaining about" (lines 22, 25, 28) demonstrate aggressive posturing inappropriate even for opinion content.

**Findings:**

The post constitutes a potential breach of Principle 5 because it's not clearly identified as opinion content, yet makes numerous opinion-based claims and character judgments. If treated as opinion, it still fails to meet professional standards through its attacks on a community member, unsubstantiated character allegations, and aggressive intimidation tactics. A news organization's social media responses should maintain journalistic standards whether labeled as opinion or not.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Not Applicable / Compliant

**Analysis:**

The Facebook post begins with a summary: "Councillor Lisa Guy voted in favour of taking QLDC's water services to an external organisation - against 75% of public submissions..." (lines 1-3).

This summary appears factually accurate based on the context provided. It states facts about:
- Lisa Guy's vote
- Opposition to public submissions
- Mayor's casting vote
- Auditor-General's opinion that she should not have voted
- Stephen Brent's role as trustee

The summary does not present opinion as fact or mislead about the content that follows. The problems arise in Crux's comments below, not in this opening summary.

**Findings:**

No breach of Principle 6. The opening summary accurately reflects the reporting and does not mislead readers.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Electoral Context:**

This post occurs during the QLDC local government elections when Lisa Guy is seeking re-election. The aggressive defense of their reporting and character attacks on Guy create several conflict of interest concerns:

1. **Crux as Electoral Actor**: By engaging in aggressive character attacks on a candidate during an election, Crux positions itself as an electoral actor rather than neutral journalist. The description of Guy's "nasty, vicious attacks" and "folksy and innocent image" is campaign-style opposition research, not journalism.

2. **Organizational Interest vs. Public Interest**: Crux's defensive responses prioritize defending their organizational reputation over serving the public interest. The aggressive demands for proof, attacks on critics, and self-justification suggest an interest in "winning" the argument rather than informing the public.

3. **Relationship with Sources**: The post reveals adversarial relationships with Lisa Guy and potentially supportive relationship with critics of Guy. This raises questions about whether Crux's coverage is influenced by personal/organizational conflicts rather than neutral assessment of facts.

**Disclosure Requirements:**

The post should disclose:
- That this exchange occurs during an election period when Guy is a candidate
- Any previous conflicts between Crux and Lisa Guy that might affect objectivity
- The nature of Robert Stewart KC's engagement (was this for legal review or journalistic verification?)
- Whether Crux has organizational interest in particular electoral outcomes

**Independence:**

Principle 10 requires publications to "be independent and free of obligations to their news sources." This post suggests Crux may have compromised independence through:
- Apparent adversarial relationship with Lisa Guy affecting objectivity
- Defensive organizational interest in "being right" rather than accurate reporting
- Possible alignment with Guy's electoral opponents (given sympathetic mention of Niki Gladding being attacked)

**Evidence:**

"Lisa has tried hard to present a 'folksy and innocent' image to the community - but her recent nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux), supported by mayor Lewers, tell an entirely different story." (line 17) - Reveals adversarial relationship and potential personal conflict affecting coverage.

"We are really looking forward to working with a new council where positive stories can be told and we can actually believe what the council comms team and all councillors tell us." (line 20) - Explicitly states preference for "a new council," indicating organizational interest in electoral outcome.

The comparison to "police...catching criminals" (line 17) reveals a law enforcement rather than journalistic mindset, suggesting Crux sees itself as prosecutor rather than neutral observer.

**Findings:**

The post constitutes a potential breach of Principle 10 by failing to disclose conflicts of interest and demonstrating compromised independence. Crux's adversarial relationship with Lisa Guy, explicit preference for "a new council," and defensive organizational interests appear to affect their electoral coverage. During an election period, news organizations must be especially careful to maintain independence and disclose any conflicts that might affect objectivity. This post suggests Crux has become an electoral actor with preferred outcomes rather than a neutral journalist serving public interest.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The post discusses public officials (Lisa Guy, Niki Gladding, Mayor Lewers) engaged in public roles during an election period. While the character attacks are unfair and unsupported, they do not constitute privacy violations as they relate to public conduct by public figures in public roles.

Christina Dawson appears to be a community member who voluntarily engaged in public discussion on Crux's Facebook page about a public election. Her comments and identity are not private in this context.

**Findings:**

No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The post does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical/mental disability. While it features female politicians and a female community member, gender is not gratuitously emphasized or made relevant to the coverage.

**Findings:**

No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this post.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The post does not involve confidential sources or confidentiality issues. All information is publicly stated on a public Facebook page.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the post involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means. The problems relate to fairness, accuracy, and opinion/fact distinction, not deceptive information gathering.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text provided does not include photographs or graphics details. Cannot assess from available information.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The post makes serious unsubstantiated character allegations against Lisa Guy ("nasty, vicious attacks") and Christina Dawson ("empty criticism has damaged"), uses aggressive intimidation tactics against a community member, shifts burden of proof while providing no evidence for its own claims, and demonstrates defensive self-justification rather than fair engagement with criticism.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The post presents opinions, characterizations, and unverified claims as factual statements. Character judgments about Lisa Guy's "folksy and innocent image" and "nasty, vicious attacks" are opinions stated as facts without supporting evidence.

3. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The post is not clearly identified as opinion content, yet makes numerous opinion-based claims. Even if treated as opinion, it fails to meet professional standards through attacks on a community member and unsubstantiated allegations.

4. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The post reveals adversarial relationship with Lisa Guy, explicit preference for "a new council," and defensive organizational interests that appear to compromise independence during an election period. Fails to disclose conflicts affecting objectivity.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This post reveals several concerning patterns:

1. **Attack Mode**: When criticized, Crux responds with character attacks on both the critic (Christina Dawson) and their subject (Lisa Guy) rather than engaging substantively with the criticism.

2. **Burden Shifting**: Crux demands critics provide proof of errors while making serious allegations (Guy's "nasty, vicious attacks," Christina's "empty criticism has damaged") without providing any evidence themselves.

3. **Self-Righteousness**: The comparison to police "catching criminals" and claim of "no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness" demonstrates lack of humility and self-awareness about their own role and limitations.

4. **Intimidation**: The repeated, aggressive demands that Christina identify specific errors (lines 22, 25, 28, 31) function to intimidate and silence criticism rather than engage constructively.

5. **Defensive Posturing**: Rather than acknowledging any possibility of error or different interpretation, Crux doubles down on characterization of subjects as deceptive ("deliberately blurring and confusing").

6. **Electoral Interference**: The explicit statement "we are really looking forward to working with a new council" reveals organizational preference for particular electoral outcome, compromising journalistic neutrality.

7. **Character Assassination**: Describing Lisa Guy as presenting false "folksy and innocent image" while really engaging in "nasty, vicious attacks" is character assassination without evidence.

8. **Double Standards**: Demanding proof from critics while providing assertions like employing "NZ's top media barrister" without verification demonstrates double standards.

These patterns suggest systemic problems with Crux's approach to journalism, criticism, and accountability. A news organization should welcome constructive criticism, engage substantively with concerns, acknowledge when reasonable people might disagree, and maintain professional standards even when defending their reporting. This post demonstrates the opposite: aggressive defensiveness, character attacks, intimidation of critics, and apparent conflicts of interest.

---

**Electoral Context:**

This post's publication during an election period when Lisa Guy is seeking re-election has critical implications:

1. **Character Assassination During Campaign**: Describing a candidate as presenting a false "folksy and innocent image" while really engaging in "nasty, vicious attacks" is precisely the kind of character attack that could influence voter decisions. Doing so without evidence during an election is especially serious.

2. **Chilling Effect on Public Discourse**: Christina Dawson's willingness to publicly support Lisa Guy and question Crux's reporting is exactly the kind of democratic engagement elections should encourage. Crux's aggressive response - telling her this has "damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy" and demanding proof - serves to intimidate and silence such engagement.

3. **Revealed Electoral Preference**: The statement "we are really looking forward to working with a new council" explicitly reveals Crux's preference for electoral change. This compromises their ability to serve as neutral election coverage source.

4. **Weaponizing Platform**: Using a media platform to attack both a candidate and her supporters during an election crosses the line from journalism to electoral activism. The aggressive tone and unsubstantiated allegations serve electoral purposes, not journalistic ones.

5. **Undermining Democratic Process**: Elections require informed public discourse where voters can assess candidates and express views without intimidation. This post undermines that process by:
   - Making serious character allegations without evidence
   - Intimidating voters who express support for candidates
   - Using media platform as weapon against candidates and supporters
   - Revealing organizational electoral preferences while claiming neutrality

The electoral timing transforms this from a concerning defensive response into serious electoral interference that potentially affects democratic outcomes. A news organization with revealed preference for "a new council" cannot credibly claim to provide neutral coverage of candidates seeking re-election.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are strong grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The post fails to fairly engage with criticism, makes unsubstantiated character allegations against both Lisa Guy and Christina Dawson, and uses aggressive intimidation tactics inappropriate for a media organization. Specific grounds:
   - Serious character allegations ("nasty, vicious attacks") without any supporting evidence
   - Attack on community member (Christina Dawson) for expressing her views ("empty criticism has damaged")
   - Burden shifting (demanding proof while providing none)
   - Aggressive, repeated demands designed to intimidate
   - No acknowledgment that reasonable interpretations might differ

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The post presents opinions and characterizations as facts without clear distinction. Specific grounds:
   - "Nasty, vicious attacks" is opinion stated as fact
   - "Folksy and innocent image" is characterization stated as fact
   - "Deliberately blurring and confusing" attributes motive as fact
   - "Empty criticism has damaged" is judgment stated as fact
   - Not clearly labeled as opinion content

**Secondary Complaints:**

3. **Principle 5 - Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**: The post is not clearly identified as opinion despite functioning as such, and fails to meet professional standards even for opinion content through attacks on community member and unsubstantiated allegations.

4. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: The post reveals conflicts affecting independence including:
   - Adversarial relationship with Lisa Guy
   - Explicit preference for "a new council"
   - Defensive organizational interest in "being right"
   - Failure to disclose conflicts during election period

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Character Attacks Without Evidence:**
   - "Lisa has tried hard to present a 'folksy and innocent' image to the community - but her recent nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux), supported by mayor Lewers, tell an entirely different story." (line 17) - Serious character allegations without any examples, quotes, dates, or supporting evidence

2. **Attack on Community Member:**
   - "With respect - we think your empty criticism has damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy." (line 17) - Using media platform to intimidate and silence criticism from private citizen

3. **Burden Shifting:**
   - "It's important that you detail exactly what is wrong with our story - please detail that for us." (line 19)
   - "We are happy to start with just one wrong fact or assumption" (line 25)
   - "From the article please - that's what you are complaining about. False assumptions or facts from the article." (line 28)
   - These repeated demands for proof while simultaneously making unsubstantiated character allegations demonstrates double standard

4. **Opinion as Fact:**
   - "She is deliberately blurring and confusing the issues around her ownership of Rationale" (line 17) - Attributes motive ("deliberately") as fact
   - "We employed NZ's top media barrister Robert Stewart KC" (line 17) - "NZ's top" is opinion; employment claim unverified
   - "We have no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness" (line 20) - Self-assessment contradicted by behavior

5. **Electoral Conflict:**
   - "We are really looking forward to working with a new council where positive stories can be told" (line 20) - Explicit preference for electoral outcome compromising neutrality

6. **Self-Aggrandizing Comparison:**
   - "Imagine the police getting criticised for being like a 'dog with a bone' in catching criminals - that's what the community want from the police and from good journalism." (line 17) - Comparing journalism to law enforcement, suggesting Crux sees itself as prosecutor rather than neutral observer

7. **Unverified Claims:**
   - Trust rating "17% - or more accurately 4%" (line 20) - Two different figures, no source
   - "QLDC has never lied to us" (line 20) - Sarcastic implication they have lied, but no specifics
   - Robert Stewart KC engagement - No documentation provided

   - Distinction between fact and opinion in social media posts
   - Standards for organizational social media conduct

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Timing**: The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher is October 27, 2025 - action should be taken soon to preserve option of complaint.

2. **Standing**: Consider who should bring complaint:
   - Lisa Guy (directly attacked with character allegations)
   - Christina Dawson (intimidated and attacked for expressing views)
   - Community member concerned about media standards
   - NZMC will consider third-party complaints but may require consent from affected individuals

3. **Public Interest**: This complaint serves public interest by:
   - Protecting democratic discourse from media intimidation
   - Ensuring community members can question reporting without attack
   - Holding media accountable for evidentiary standards
   - Protecting candidates from unsubstantiated character assassination
   - Maintaining media independence during elections

4. **Pattern Evidence**: If pursuing complaint, investigate:
   - Other examples of Crux attacking critics on social media
   - Pattern of unsubstantiated character allegations
   - History of conflicts with QLDC officials
   - Previous NZMC complaints against Crux (per ReviewContext.MD)
   - Whether this defensive posturing is systematic

5. **Social Media Standards**: This complaint could establish important precedent:
   - NZMC principles apply to social media posts by news organizations
   - Media organizations cannot use platforms to intimidate critics
   - Character allegations require evidence regardless of platform
   - Professional standards apply to organizational social media accounts

6. **Electoral Integrity**: Document:
   - Timing during election period
   - Impact on candidates (Lisa Guy)
   - Impact on democratic discourse (Christina's chilling)
   - Crux's revealed electoral preferences
   - Compromise of journalistic independence

**Conclusion:**

This Facebook post represents a serious failure of journalistic and ethical standards. Rather than engaging constructively with legitimate community criticism, Crux weaponized their platform to attack both the critic (Christina Dawson) and their subject (Lisa Guy) with unsubstantiated character allegations while demanding proof they refused to provide themselves.

The pattern revealed is deeply concerning: aggressive defensiveness, character assassination without evidence, intimidation of community members, burden shifting, revealed electoral preferences, and compromised independence. These behaviors fall well below the standards expected of professional journalism, particularly during an election period when democratic discourse requires protection rather than suppression.

The post's impact extends beyond the specific individuals attacked:
- It chills democratic participation by signaling that questioning Crux invites public attack
- It undermines electoral integrity through character assassination without evidence
- It reveals organizational conflicts of interest affecting election coverage
- It demonstrates systemic problems with accountability and professional standards

A formal complaint is strongly warranted and should be pursued urgently. The complaint serves not only to address this specific post but to establish important precedents: that NZMC principles apply to social media, that news organizations cannot intimidate critics, that character allegations require evidence, and that media independence during elections must be maintained. The one-month deadline (October 27, 2025) requires prompt action to preserve the option of formal complaint.
