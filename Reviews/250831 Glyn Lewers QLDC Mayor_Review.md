# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor's Post
**Publication:** Crux (Facebook comment exchange)
**Date:** August 31, 2025
**Author:** Interaction between Glyn Lewers and Crux (Peter Newport)
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This content appears to be a Facebook post by Mayor Glyn Lewers responding to Crux reporting, followed by public comments from Crux questioning his campaign funding and operations. The exchange reveals concerning journalistic practices including allegations without evidence, hostile questioning on public platforms, legal threats mentioned but not detailed, and failure to use proper channels for information gathering. Multiple NZMC principles appear to have been breached, particularly regarding accuracy and fairness (Principle 1), and conflicts of interest during an election period (Principle 10).

---

## Article Summary
The content consists of:

**Part 1 - Lewers' Facebook Post (lines 1-16):**
Mayor Glyn Lewers posts a detailed statement addressing "stories on Crux" that he characterizes as suggesting a "conspiracy" about his election campaign team. He provides specific denials and clarifications about:
- His campaign team composition (paid and volunteer)
- Scope Communications providing paid marketing support
- Richard Thomas not funding his campaign
- Ann Lockhart not being paid campaign manager
- His campaign website and budget
- His qualifications to manage the legally allowed $30k budget
- His commitment to proper disclosure through the Electoral Officer
- Allegations he characterizes as untrue regarding overspending, rewards to volunteers, or "untoward" campaign activities
- Concerns about divisive behavior at town hall meetings

**Part 2 - Crux Public Comments (lines 18-32):**
Crux (apparently Peter Newport) publicly demands answers about campaign funding, team composition, and Richard Thomas's role. The exchange includes:
- Demand for public answers on the Facebook platform rather than email
- Claims of "legal threats" with no answers provided
- Allegations about "new restrictions" on Lewers' Facebook page based on "multiple complaints"
- Details about questions sent to Scope Communications (August 27) with a noon August 28 deadline
- Extensive list of questions including campaign funding, video production costs, media access restrictions, and a serious allegation about a "false claim" regarding Olivia Wensley being on a conflict of interest list

---

## Context Considerations
Per ReviewContext.MD, the Queenstown Lakes local government elections are underway. This places all coverage in an electoral context requiring heightened attention to fairness and balance. Crux has a documented history of complaints and directions from the New Zealand Media Council, including five previous cases (60% upheld) demonstrating patterns of:
- Inadequate right of reply
- Mixing opinion with news without clear labeling
- Hostile email exchanges with subjects
- "Serious breakdown in professional relationship" with QLDC entities
- Failure to seriously engage with complainants
- Presenting speculation as fact

The historical pattern of breaches involving QLDC officials and contractors is directly relevant to assessing this current exchange. The Media Council previously noted "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism marked by stonewalling and hostile email exchanges" and advised Crux to "take greater care" and maintain professional standards.

This exchange occurs during an active election campaign where Mayor Lewers is presumably seeking re-election (though this is not explicitly stated in the content provided). The electoral timing raises the stakes for fair and accurate reporting.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**
Crux makes several serious allegations in public comments without providing supporting evidence or documentation:

1. **"Legal threats" allegation (line 19):** Crux claims "no answers - just legal threats" without:
   - Specifying what the legal threats were
   - Providing documentation or quotes
   - Explaining the context or justification
   - Allowing readers to assess whether concerns were legitimate

2. **"Whole range of new restrictions" allegation (lines 29-30):** Crux claims "multiple complaints from people who have been refused access to your content for a variety of reasons" without:
   - Identifying who complained
   - Specifying what restrictions exist
   - Providing evidence of systematic access denial
   - Considering legitimate reasons for social media moderation

3. **"False claim" allegation (line 32):** Crux alleges "Mayor Lewers made what we understand to be a false claim in the previous 2022 campaign to Crux that Olivia Wensley was on a QLDC conflict of interest list - but it was then established (from CEO Theelen) that the list did not exist." This serious allegation:
   - Uses hedging language ("what we understand to be") suggesting uncertainty
   - Does not provide documentation or direct quotes from either the original claim or CEO Theelen's response
   - Raises a 3-year-old allegation without current relevance to 2025 campaign questions
   - Appears designed to damage credibility rather than seek genuine information

4. **Question about Sam Stubbs housing launch:** "Why did Glyn Lewers not invite other local media and councillors as requested by Sam Stubbs at Simplicity for his recent rent to buy housing launch?" (line 32) This question assumes facts not established:
   - That other media were not invited
   - That councillors were specifically requested by Stubbs
   - That Lewers had exclusive control over invitations

**Fairness Issues:**

1. **Public interrogation vs. professional inquiry:** Rather than following standard journalism practice of requesting an interview, sending written questions privately, or accepting the mayor's offer to respond via email (line 25), Crux conducts hostile public interrogation on social media demanding answers "on this platform, and open to the entire community" (line 29).

2. **Timing and deadline pressure:** Crux sent questions to Scope Communications on August 27 with a 12-noon August 28 deadline (line 32) - approximately 24 hours notice. This does not constitute reasonable time for considered response, particularly if Scope needed to consult with their client.

3. **Public characterization of communications:** Describing responses as "legal threats" (line 19) without context or detail unfairly characterizes legitimate legal concerns a public figure might have about defamatory allegations.

4. **Pattern of assumptions:** The questions contain embedded accusations:
   - Assuming Richard Thomas has an undisclosed funding role
   - Assuming Scope is "discounting their usual fees" (suggesting improper benefit)
   - Assuming Lewers deliberately excluded media from events
   - Assuming the 2022 "false claim" was deliberately misleading

**Balance Issues:**

1. **No publication of Lewers' perspective:** While this document shows Lewers' Facebook post (lines 1-16), there is no indication Crux published his detailed responses to their allegations in balanced news coverage. His Facebook post appears to be his only avenue to respond to "stories on Crux."

2. **No context for questions:** Crux provides no balanced context for why these questions matter to voters or what public interest is served, beyond apparent "gotcha" journalism.

3. **Selective focus on one candidate:** Crux states "we'll be sure to be asking exactly the same questions of the other main mayoral candidates" (line 19), acknowledging the need for balance but indicating they have not yet done so. Publishing allegations about one candidate before comparable scrutiny of others creates imbalance during an election period.

**Evidence:**

"Can you tell us who exactly is funding your campaign Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor and address the other questions we've put to your team - no answers - just legal threats." (lines 18-19) - This public accusation provides no evidence of what questions were asked, what "legal threats" were made, or whether concerns raised were legitimate.

"All we want are the facts" (line 19) - This framing positions Crux as simply seeking truth while implying Lewers is hiding something, when in fact Lewers offered to respond via email (line 25) and Crux refused this professional channel.

"We sent these questions to Scope Communications on August 27 with a deadline of 12 noon August 28 - hoping for an answer on your behalf. No replies supplied." (lines 32-33) - A 24-hour deadline followed by public criticism of non-response demonstrates unfair treatment, particularly when questions include serious historical allegations requiring research to address properly.

"Mayor Lewers made what we understand to be a false claim in the previous 2022 campaign to Crux that Olivia Wensley was on a QLDC conflict of interest list - but it was then established (from CEO Theelen) that the list did not exist. What's your explanation for that episode?" (line 32) - This allegation is presented as established fact ("it was then established") while simultaneously hedged with uncertainty ("what we understand to be"), and no documentation is provided.

**Findings:**
This exchange constitutes a clear breach of Principle 1. Crux makes serious allegations without supporting evidence, refuses professional channels for information gathering, conducts hostile public interrogation, imposes unrealistic deadlines, and fails to provide balance by scrutinizing other candidates equally. The allegations about "legal threats" and "false claims" are particularly problematic as they damage reputation without providing evidence or fair opportunity for response. The pattern mirrors the Media Council's previous findings in Case 2940 regarding "hostile email exchanges" and Case 3356 regarding "paltry efforts" to properly engage with subjects.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The Crux comments blur the line between factual reporting and opinion/advocacy by presenting unverified allegations as established facts.

**Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**

1. **"Legal threats" (line 19):** Presented as fact without evidence. Whether communications were genuinely "threats" or legitimate legal concerns about defamation is a matter of interpretation and opinion, yet Crux states this as objective fact.

2. **"No answers" (line 19):** This characterization is contradicted by Lewers' detailed Facebook post (lines 1-16) which provides extensive answers. Whether these answers are satisfactory is opinion; that no answers were provided is demonstrably incorrect.

3. **"False claim" (line 32):** The use of "what we understand to be a false claim" hedges factually while still making a defamatory allegation. If Crux has evidence it was false, they should present it clearly. If they don't have evidence, they shouldn't make the allegation.

4. **"Multiple complaints" about Facebook restrictions (line 29):** Presented as fact without verification of who complained, whether complaints were valid, or whether restrictions exist for legitimate moderation reasons.

**Lack of Clear Identification:**

This content appears on what seems to be Crux's Facebook page or in Crux's capacity as a news organization commenting publicly. The comments are not clearly labeled as:
- Opinion/commentary vs. news reporting
- Legitimate news inquiry vs. political advocacy
- Ongoing investigation vs. established findings

The aggressive questioning style and public confrontation suggest advocacy journalism or opinion, but this is not clearly signaled to readers who may interpret Crux's statements as factual reporting.

**Factual Foundation:**

Many of Crux's claims and questions lack proper factual foundation:

1. The "legal threats" claim provides no quotes, documentation, or context
2. The "false claim" allegation about Olivia Wensley provides no documentation of the original claim or CEO Theelen's correction
3. Questions about Richard Thomas's role assume facts not established (that he has an undisclosed funding or operational role)
4. Claims about Facebook restrictions provide no verification or specific examples

**Evidence:**

"You haven't sent any questions directly to me. Please send to glyn.lewers@gmail.com and I will respond where appropriate." (line 25) - Lewers clearly offers to respond via professional channel.

"We'd prefer your answers to be on this platform, and open to the entire community - if you answer our questions (by email) we are obviously going to publish the answers. So - are you saying you won't answer these questions? Why not?" (line 29) - Crux refuses the professional channel and frames this refusal as Lewers being uncooperative, blurring the fact that Lewers offered to respond.

"We agree that the answers should be direct from you - thank you - but we have had problems getting replies in the past." (line 32) - This frames historical difficulties as Lewers' fault without acknowledging Crux's own documented pattern (per Case 2940) of hostile communications and "festering mutual suspicion."

**Findings:**
The exchange breaches Principle 4 by presenting opinions, characterizations, and unverified allegations as facts. Crux's comments about "legal threats," "false claims," and "no answers" are interpretations and opinions presented as objective facts. The aggressive public questioning is advocacy/opinion journalism but is not clearly labeled as such, creating the appearance of factual news reporting. This mirrors the Media Council's findings in Cases 2891, 2895, and 2940 where Crux repeatedly failed to distinguish between factual information and opinion.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**
This social media exchange is not clearly identified as opinion or commentary. It appears to be conducted in Crux's capacity as a news organization, creating ambiguity about whether this is:
- News reporting
- Editorial opinion/commentary
- Advocacy journalism
- Personal views of Peter Newport

Based on previous Media Council findings (Case 2895), when "Peter Newport's tone reflects his own views," this should be clearly labeled as opinion. The public Facebook exchange contains Newport's views and advocacy but is presented under the Crux organizational identity without clear labeling.

**Foundation of Fact:**
Even if treated as opinion content, the exchange has significant weaknesses in factual foundation:

1. **"Legal threats" allegation:** No documentation or evidence provided
2. **"False claim" about Olivia Wensley:** No quotes from original 2022 statement or CEO Theelen's correction provided
3. **"Multiple complaints" about Facebook restrictions:** No verification of complaints or investigation of whether restrictions exist
4. **Questions about funding and team roles:** Based on assumptions rather than established facts

While Principle 5 states "with comment and opinion balance is not essential," this protection applies to clearly identified opinion. When opinion is presented in a news organization's voice without clear labeling, and when it makes factual allegations without foundation, it does not meet the "foundation of fact" requirement.

**Evidence:**

The exchange is conducted in Crux's organizational voice (commenting as "Crux") rather than clearly identified as Peter Newport's personal opinion. This creates ambiguity about whether readers should interpret this as news reporting by the organization or individual commentary.

Previous Media Council guidance to Crux (Case 2895) "strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future" regarding mixing "opinion liberally sprinkled through a story presented as news." This social media exchange appears to be opinion and advocacy presented in news organization's voice without clear distinction.

**Findings:**
This constitutes a potential breach of Principle 5. The content functions as opinion and advocacy but is not clearly identified as such when presented in Crux's organizational voice. Even if treated as opinion, the lack of factual foundation for serious allegations (legal threats, false claims) violates the requirement that "material facts on which an opinion is based should be accurate." The Media Council previously found (Case 2891) that Crux "mixed opinion with news" without clear labeling - this exchange appears to continue that pattern.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

**Analysis:**
The content provided does not include headlines or captions in the traditional sense. This is a Facebook post and comment exchange rather than a published article with headline. However, the document title "250831 Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor's Post" appears to be an archive identifier rather than a published headline.

**Findings:**
No formal breach can be assessed as there is no headline to evaluate. However, if Crux published articles about this exchange with headlines, those should be reviewed separately for accuracy and fairness.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Electoral Context:**
This exchange occurs during an active election period (as confirmed by ReviewContext.MD stating "Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections are underway"). The electoral context creates several conflict of interest issues:

1. **Campaign impact without disclosure:** Crux's public allegations about campaign funding, "legal threats," and "false claims" have substantial potential to damage Lewers' electoral prospects. The aggressive public questioning may influence voter perceptions without proper investigation or evidence.

2. **Selective scrutiny timing:** Crux states "we'll be sure to be asking exactly the same questions of the other main mayoral candidates" (line 19), acknowledging they have not yet done so. Publishing damaging allegations about one candidate before comparable scrutiny of others creates unfair electoral advantage/disadvantage during an election period.

3. **Lack of electoral context disclosure:** The exchange does not clearly frame this as election coverage or disclose that timing during an election period raises the stakes for fairness and accuracy.

**Relationship Disclosure:**
The exchange reveals a problematic relationship between Crux and Mayor Lewers:

1. **Historical antagonism:** Reference to "problems getting replies in the past" (line 32) and the mayor's defensive tone suggesting past "stories on Crux" alleging conspiracies (line 4) indicate an adversarial relationship.

2. **Documented pattern:** The ReviewContext.MD notes Crux has "a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council" with the Media Council previously finding a "serious breakdown in professional relationship" with QLDC entities and "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism marked by stonewalling and hostile email exchanges" (Case 2940).

3. **No disclosure of history:** Crux does not disclose this problematic history when making new allegations, which would help readers understand the context of the confrontational exchange.

**Watchdog Role Independence:**
Principle 10 requires publications to "be independent and free of obligations to their news sources" and "avoid any situations that might compromise such independence."

The exchange suggests Crux has moved from independent watchdog to active antagonist:

1. **Hostile interrogation:** Demanding public answers on social media rather than professional inquiry
2. **Unrealistic deadlines:** 24-hour deadline (August 27 to noon August 28) does not allow reasonable response time
3. **Refusal of professional channels:** Rejecting mayor's offer to respond via email in favor of public confrontation
4. **Embedded accusations:** Questions containing unproven assumptions about improper funding, discounted services, and false claims

This approach suggests Crux's relationship with the mayor has become adversarial to the point of compromising independent journalism. The pattern mirrors Case 2940 where the Media Council noted Crux's "hostile email exchanges" and "growing antagonism" interfered with professional journalism standards.

**Evidence:**

"Over the past 48 hours there have been some stories on Crux that seem to suggest some sort of conspiracy about my election campaign team." (line 4) - Lewers characterizes recent Crux coverage as alleging conspiracy, suggesting potentially defamatory reporting that prompted this defensive post.

"It appears that Crux is suggesting there is some sort of conspiracy going on as part of its fixation with my campaign." (line 14) - Lewers uses terms "conspiracy" and "fixation" suggesting Crux's coverage has crossed from legitimate scrutiny to targeted attack.

"Can you tell us who exactly is funding your campaign... no answers - just legal threats." (line 19) - Characterization of legal concerns as "threats" suggests adversarial relationship rather than professional journalism.

"We'd prefer your answers to be on this platform, and open to the entire community" (line 29) - Insistence on public forum rather than professional channels suggests prioritizing confrontation over information-gathering.

"We sent these questions to Scope Communications on August 27 with a deadline of 12 noon August 28" (line 32) - Unrealistic 24-hour deadline during an election period suggests intention to create "gotcha" moment rather than genuine inquiry.

"We'll be sure to be asking exactly the same questions of the other main mayoral candidates." (line 19) - Admission that other candidates have not received comparable scrutiny demonstrates selective targeting during election period.

**Findings:**
This constitutes a breach of Principle 10. Crux fails to disclose the electoral context and campaign impact of its allegations, fails to disclose its documented adversarial history with QLDC officials, and engages in selective scrutiny of one candidate during an election period. The hostile, public confrontation approach suggests the relationship has become so antagonistic that it compromises independent journalism. The pattern continues the Media Council's previous findings (Case 2940) about Crux's "serious breakdown in professional relationship" and "hostile email exchanges" with QLDC entities. During an election period, this failure to maintain independence and disclose conflicts is particularly serious as it may unfairly influence electoral outcomes.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The content does not raise privacy concerns. All individuals named (Lewers, Richard Thomas, Ann Lockhart, Lauren Prebble, Olivia Wensley, Sam Stubbs, CEO Theelen) are public officials, campaign staff, or public figures engaged in matters of legitimate public interest. Questions about campaign funding, team composition, and electoral conduct during an election period are clearly matters of public interest and public record.

The mayor's campaign finances and team are subject to legal disclosure requirements under the Local Electoral Act 2001 (mentioned line 11, 13), making this information public rather than private.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The exchange does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical or mental disability. The focus is entirely on campaign funding and electoral conduct.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this exchange.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The exchange does not involve confidential sources. All information discussed should be public or subject to legal disclosure requirements.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the exchange involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. The confrontation is public and direct.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The content provided does not include photographs or graphics details that can be assessed.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: Crux makes serious allegations without supporting evidence, including claims about "legal threats" and "false claims" with no documentation. The hostile public interrogation, unrealistic 24-hour deadline, and refusal of professional communication channels demonstrate unfair treatment. Selective scrutiny of one candidate during an election period without comparable investigation of others violates balance requirements.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: Crux presents opinions and characterizations as facts, including the "legal threats" characterization, the "no answers" claim (contradicted by Lewers' detailed post), and the "false claim" allegation presented with hedging language but no evidence. The exchange functions as opinion/advocacy but is presented in the news organization's voice without clear labeling.

3. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - BREACH**: Crux fails to disclose the electoral context and timing, fails to disclose its documented adversarial history with QLDC officials, and engages in selective scrutiny during an election period. The hostile approach suggests the relationship has become so antagonistic it compromises independent journalism.

4. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The exchange functions as opinion and advocacy but is presented in Crux's organizational voice without clear identification as such. Even treated as opinion, the lack of factual foundation for serious allegations violates requirements that opinions be based on accurate facts.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This exchange demonstrates continuation of patterns previously identified by the Media Council in cases 2891, 2895, 2940, and 3356:

1. **Hostile Communications Pattern:** The Media Council found in Case 2940 a "serious breakdown in professional relationship" with QLDC entities marked by "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" and "hostile email exchanges." This Facebook exchange demonstrates the pattern continues, now conducted in public social media rather than private email.

2. **Fact/Opinion Confusion:** Cases 2891, 2895, and 2940 found Crux repeatedly mixed opinion with news without clear labeling, presenting "opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news" (Case 2895). This exchange continues that pattern by presenting characterizations and allegations as facts under the news organization's identity.

3. **Inadequate Effort to Obtain Information:** Case 3356 found Crux's reliance on social media and failure to use available contact information was a "paltry effort." This exchange shows Crux refusing the mayor's offered email channel in favor of public confrontation, suggesting prioritization of conflict over information-gathering.

4. **Unverified Allegations:** Cases 2891 and 2940 found Crux presented speculation and claims as fact without proper verification. The "legal threats" and "false claim" allegations in this exchange follow that pattern.

5. **Failure to Seriously Engage:** Case 3356 found Crux "does not appear to have seriously engaged" with complainants' specific concerns. The 24-hour deadline and refusal of professional communication channels suggest similar lack of serious engagement here.

6. **Electoral Context:** This is the first documented exchange during an active election period. The failure to apply heightened fairness and balance standards during an election demonstrates Crux has not learned from previous Media Council guidance about maintaining ethical journalism standards.

**Escalation Concerns:**
This exchange is particularly concerning because it demonstrates:
- Previous Media Council directions have not changed Crux's practices
- The antagonistic relationship with QLDC officials continues to deteriorate
- Hostile exchanges have moved from private (email) to public (social media)
- Unverified allegations are now made in public forums where they can immediately influence an election
- Crux continues to refuse professional journalism channels in favor of confrontation

---

**Electoral Context:**

This exchange's occurrence during an active election period has critical implications:

1. **Campaign Damage Without Evidence:** Public allegations about "legal threats," campaign funding irregularities, and "false claims" can damage electoral prospects immediately, during the period when voters are forming opinions. Making such allegations without supporting evidence is particularly harmful during elections.

2. **Unfair Electoral Advantage/Disadvantage:** Crux admits it has not yet applied comparable scrutiny to "other main mayoral candidates" (line 19). Selective negative coverage of one candidate during an election period creates unfair electoral dynamics.

3. **Voter Information Quality:** Voters relying on Crux for information about the mayoral race receive unverified allegations and hostile confrontation rather than balanced reporting that would enable informed choice.

4. **Electoral Integrity:** The Local Electoral Act 2001 (referenced lines 11, 13) requires proper disclosure of campaign finances through the Electoral Officer. Crux's public allegations suggest impropriety before legal disclosure requirements are triggered (at election conclusion), potentially interfering with the proper electoral process.

5. **Public Interest vs. Public Forum:** While campaign financing is clearly a matter of public interest, conducting hostile interrogation on public social media platforms during an election is different from responsible investigative journalism. The public forum amplifies both the allegations and their electoral impact without the verification and balance that responsible electoral journalism requires.

6. **Heightened Standards Required:** The NZMC Preamble states "An independent press plays a vital role in a democracy." During elections, this vital role requires heightened attention to fairness, accuracy, and balance because coverage directly affects democratic outcomes. This exchange demonstrates Crux applying lower rather than higher standards during the critical electoral period.

The electoral timing transforms what would be serious breaches into critical failures of democratic journalism that may affect electoral outcomes and voter choice.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are strong grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The exchange fails to provide fair treatment and makes unverified allegations. Specific grounds:
   - Allegations of "legal threats" without documentation or evidence
   - Allegations of "false claim" about Olivia Wensley without providing original statement or CEO Theelen's correction
   - Claims of "no answers" when Lewers provided detailed Facebook post with answers
   - Unrealistic 24-hour deadline for complex questions involving historical allegations
   - Refusal of professional communication channels (email) in favor of hostile public interrogation
   - Selective scrutiny of one candidate during election period without comparable investigation of others
   - Questions containing embedded unproven assumptions about improper conduct

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The exchange fails to clearly distinguish between factual information and opinion. Specific grounds:
   - "Legal threats" presented as fact when this is characterization/opinion
   - "False claim" allegation presented as fact with only hedged evidence ("what we understand to be")
   - "Multiple complaints" about Facebook restrictions presented as fact without verification
   - Aggressive questioning style is opinion/advocacy presented in news organization voice without clear labeling
   - Contradictory claim of "no answers" when detailed answers were provided

3. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: The exchange fails to disclose conflicts and maintain independence. Specific grounds:
   - Electoral context not adequately disclosed despite serious allegations during active election
   - Admission of selective scrutiny (other candidates not yet questioned) creating unfair electoral impact
   - Documented adversarial history with QLDC officials not disclosed to readers
   - Hostile approach suggests relationship has become so antagonistic it compromises independent journalism
   - Continuation of pattern found by Media Council in Case 2940 regarding "serious breakdown in professional relationship"

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 5 - Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**: The exchange functions as opinion/advocacy but is presented in news organization voice without clear identification, and lacks proper factual foundation.

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Unverified Allegations:**
   - "No answers - just legal threats" (line 19) - No documentation of what legal concerns were raised or whether they were legitimate
   - "Mayor Lewers made what we understand to be a false claim in the previous 2022 campaign to Crux that Olivia Wensley was on a QLDC conflict of interest list - but it was then established (from CEO Theelen) that the list did not exist" (line 32) - Hedged language ("what we understand to be") combined with definitive claim ("it was then established") with no supporting documentation
   - "Multiple complaints from people who have been refused access to your content" (line 29) - No verification of complaints or investigation of whether restrictions are legitimate moderation

2. **Hostile Approach vs. Professional Standards:**
   - "We'd prefer your answers to be on this platform, and open to the entire community" (line 29) - Refusal of professional channel (email offered line 25) in favor of public confrontation
   - "We sent these questions to Scope Communications on August 27 with a deadline of 12 noon August 28" (line 32) - Unrealistic 24-hour deadline for complex questions
   - Questions sent to communications firm rather than directly to candidate, then public criticism when no response within 24 hours

3. **Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**
   - "No answers" claim (line 19) contradicted by Lewers' detailed Facebook post providing extensive answers (lines 1-16)
   - "Legal threats" characterization presents opinion about nature of communications as objective fact
   - Questions contain embedded accusations presented as facts: "Is Scope discounting their usual fees" (line 32) assumes improper benefit without evidence

4. **Electoral Context - Selective Scrutiny:**
   - "We'll be sure to be asking exactly the same questions of the other main mayoral candidates" (line 19) - Admission that other candidates have not received comparable scrutiny during election period
   - Serious allegations made publicly during active election without comparable investigation of other candidates
   - No disclosure that timing during election period raises fairness stakes

5. **Pattern Evidence - Historical Context:**
   - Reference to "problems getting replies in the past" (line 32) without acknowledging Crux's own documented pattern of hostile communications (Case 2940)
   - Continuation of "serious breakdown in professional relationship" found by Media Council in Case 2940
   - Pattern of mixing opinion with news without clear labeling (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940)
   - Pattern of inadequate efforts to obtain information (Case 3356 - "paltry effort")

---

**Required Actions per NZMC Procedure:**

**Step 1 - Complaint to Publisher (Crux):**
- **Timing**: Must be within one calendar month of first publication (August 31, 2025)
- **Deadline**: September 30, 2025
- **Status**: DEADLINE HAS PASSED as of review date (October 3, 2025)
- **Action Required**: Request Chair waive time limit due to:
  - Content was Facebook exchange, not clearly a "published article" triggering complaint timeline awareness
  - Electoral timing meant immediate response was focused on campaign rather than Media Council process
  - Public interest in addressing pattern of breaches during ongoing election

**Alternative - If Within Timeline:**
- **Method**: Written complaint clearly marked as complaint to publisher
- **Content**: Should cite specific principle breaches and request:
  - Retraction of unverified allegations about "legal threats" and "false claims"
  - Apology for hostile public interrogation during election period
  - Publication of Lewers' responses with fair prominence
  - Commitment to apply comparable scrutiny to all candidates
  - Clear labeling of opinion/advocacy vs. news reporting going forward
  - Adherence to professional communication channels rather than public confrontation

**Step 2 - Escalation to NZMC:**
- **Timing**: If no response within 10 working days, or if response is unsatisfactory
- **Deadline**: Within 20 working days of publisher's response (or non-response)
- **Method**: Online complaint form at NZMC website
- **Requirements**:
  - State principles breached (Principles 1, 4, 10, and potentially 5)
  - Provide link to Facebook exchange and screenshots/copies
  - Include initial complaint to publisher and their response
  - Provide key points in 500 words
  - Provide proper name (will be published unless exceptional circumstances)
  - Sign waiver (no other formal action regarding same matter)
  - Reference historical pattern (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940, 3356) showing Crux has not corrected practices despite previous Media Council directions

**Step 3 - Supporting Documentation to Gather:**
- Screenshots of full Facebook exchange with timestamps
- Any Crux articles from past 48 hours (referenced line 4) alleging "conspiracy"
- Documentation of questions sent to Scope Communications (if available)
- Any correspondence regarding "legal threats" (if appropriate to disclose)
- Documentation of 2022 Olivia Wensley incident (Lewers' original statement, CEO Theelen's response)
- Evidence of whether other mayoral candidates received comparable scrutiny
- Previous Media Council decisions (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940, 3356) showing pattern

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of decision with fair prominence in the section where original exchange occurred (on Facebook and any related articles)

2. **Online Correction**: Any enduring copy of related articles must carry note at top that content was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Retraction of Unverified Allegations**: Request NZMC direct retraction of:
   - "Legal threats" allegation without evidence
   - "False claim" allegation without documentation
   - "No answers" claim contradicted by Lewers' detailed response
   - Claims about Facebook restrictions without verification

4. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for Mayor Lewers to be given fair prominence in Crux, addressing:
   - The campaign funding questions with detailed responses
   - The 2022 Olivia Wensley incident with full context
   - His perspective on communication difficulties with Crux
   - Electoral impact of unverified allegations

5. **Process Improvements**: Request NZMC direct Crux to establish clear editorial policies for:
   - Electoral coverage requiring balance and comparable scrutiny of all candidates
   - Prohibition on making serious allegations without supporting evidence
   - Use of professional communication channels rather than public confrontation
   - Clear labeling of opinion/advocacy vs. news content
   - Reasonable deadlines for response (not 24 hours for complex questions)
   - Disclosure of adversarial relationships and conflicts of interest

6. **Acknowledgment of Pattern**: Request NZMC acknowledge this is at least the 6th complaint involving Crux and QLDC officials/contractors, demonstrating pattern despite previous directions to "take greater care"

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Timing Challenge**: The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher appears to have passed (August 31 to September 30). Request for Chair waiver will be needed with strong justification:
   - Facebook exchange format created ambiguity about whether this was "published article" triggering complaint timeline
   - Electoral timing meant mayor focused on campaign response rather than Media Council process
   - Public interest in addressing ongoing pattern during active election
   - Crux's documented pattern (5 previous cases) suggests systemic issues requiring intervention

2. **Public Interest**: This complaint serves public interest by:
   - Protecting electoral integrity and fair campaign coverage during active election
   - Ensuring voters receive verified information rather than unproven allegations
   - Holding media accountable for maintaining standards during critical democratic period
   - Addressing pattern of breaches (6th complaint) showing previous Media Council directions were ineffective
   - Protecting public officials from unverified defamatory allegations

3. **Standing**: Consider who should bring complaint:
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers (directly affected, reputation damaged during election)
   - Community member concerned about electoral journalism fairness
   - NZMC may require consent from Lewers as he is the subject
   - Lewers has strongest standing as directly affected party

4. **Pattern Evidence**: This complaint is strengthened by documented pattern:
   - Case 2891 (March 2020) - Upheld for lack of balance and mixing fact/opinion
   - Case 2895 (May 2020) - Not upheld but "strongly suggests Crux take greater care"
   - Case 2940 (September 2020) - Upheld with finding of "serious breakdown in professional relationship" and "hostile email exchanges"
   - Case 3012 (March 2021) - Not upheld but noted "sloppy reporting"
   - Case 3356 (December 2022) - Upheld, Council "disappointed by Crux's conduct"
   - This case (August 2025) - Same patterns continue nearly 5 years after first upheld complaint

5. **Electoral Impact Documentation**: Document potential electoral impact:
   - Public allegations of campaign funding irregularities without evidence
   - Claims of "legal threats" and "false claims" that damage credibility
   - Selective scrutiny creating unfair electoral advantage for other candidates
   - Timing during active election when voters are forming decisions
   - Reach of Crux and Facebook in Queenstown-Lakes district

6. **Unique Social Media Dimension**: This case presents novel issues:
   - Hostile journalism conducted on public social media platform rather than in articles
   - Immediate public visibility and electoral impact of unverified allegations
   - Refusal of professional channels in favor of public confrontation
   - Whether NZMC principles apply to news organizations' social media conduct
   - Precedent-setting potential for social media journalism standards

7. **Broader Reform**: This complaint could serve as foundation for:
   - Clearer NZMC guidance on electoral journalism during campaigns
   - Standards for news organizations' social media conduct
   - Escalating remedies when patterns of breaches continue despite previous rulings
   - Industry standards for deadlines and professional communication
   - Requirements to disclose adversarial relationships that may compromise independence

**Key Principles Applied in This Review:**

1. **Evidence-Based**: All breach findings cite specific passages from exchange
2. **Proportionate**: Distinguishes between clear breaches, potential breaches, and compliant content
3. **Contextual**: Considers electoral timing, historical pattern, and public interest implications
4. **Practical**: Provides actionable recommendations despite timeline challenges
5. **Pattern-Focused**: Emphasizes this is 6th complaint showing systemic issues despite previous Media Council directions

**Conclusion:**

This Facebook exchange represents a continuation and escalation of patterns previously identified by the Media Council in five complaints against Crux between 2020-2022. The hostile public interrogation, unverified allegations, refusal of professional communication channels, and selective scrutiny during an active election period demonstrate that previous Media Council directions to "take greater care" and warnings about "serious breakdown in professional relationship" have not changed Crux's practices.

The exchange is particularly concerning because:
1. **Pattern Persistence**: Same breaches continue nearly 5 years after first upheld complaint
2. **Escalation**: Hostile approach has moved from private email to public social media
3. **Electoral Timing**: Breaches occur during active election when impact is maximized
4. **Evidence Absence**: Serious allegations made with no supporting documentation
5. **Professional Standards**: Rejection of professional channels in favor of confrontation

The primary function of this exchange appears to be public confrontation and electoral damage rather than legitimate information-gathering journalism. This undermines both electoral integrity and public trust in journalism.

A formal complaint is strongly warranted despite the timeline challenge. The complaint serves not only to address this specific exchange but to establish that repeated patterns of breaches require escalating remedies when previous Media Council directions prove ineffective. The complaint also raises important questions about journalistic standards for news organizations' conduct on social media platforms during election periods.

The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher has passed (August 31 to September 30), requiring a request for Chair waiver. Strong grounds exist for waiver based on the Facebook exchange format creating ambiguity, electoral timing affecting complainant's priorities, and significant public interest in addressing ongoing pattern during active election.
