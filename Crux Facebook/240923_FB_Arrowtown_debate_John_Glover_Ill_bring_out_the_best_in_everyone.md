We need bold, transparent leadership. Thank you John Glover for Mayor for having the courage to stand up to this on our behalf. Exactly what a mayor should be doing.

Shhhh John. You’re supposed to do everything in secret and not let anyone know all the dodgy back room deals that’s going on. Who do you think you’re there to represent? The residents? Oh you naive soul you! 🤣

Glyn promotes his own "transparency", how dare anyone else be transparent on what he is doing in the shadows...

Because there's such a thing as too transparent? Sewers, carry on updating your cv and leave the adults to do things properly. You have created culture of opacity, borderline corruption, mistrust and cultivated perception of mistrust by the electorate.

And there's Glyn, again with absolutely no self-awareness, railing against openness and transparency.
