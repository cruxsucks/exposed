Lisa Guy says the CEO recruitment process that she, Mayor Lewers and Lyal Cocks are involved in is "transparent" but documents will have to be requested under a post-election official information process. She also attacks Councillor Niki Gladding in an email to all councillors. We publish the emails in full.

“Maybe instead of another election or chasing a new CEO, QLDC should just be put under administration, At least then we might finally see some decent governance and on-the-ground management.”

To tell John Glover, a current councillor, to apply for the information from a government agency when it should be available to all councillors is ridiculous and smacks of underhand dealings.

Melita Richards he is not a councillor, he is running for mayor. Niki’s request was put through the application process as will all others. Next Council will blame the last council and ‘move on’ laughing at us all yet again.

She is one of the QLDC'S major problems. Is she still a shareholder in a company that receives QLDC contracts? Conflict of interest??

Great response from John Glover. But the answer to this problem, lies in the Auditor-General's guidance - 'We suggest that councils consider the most appropriate time to recruit a new chief executive, avoiding where possible periods immediately preceding or following an election'. Could it be any clearer?

This nonsense from Lisa Guy is a great example of the problems we face with the current set-up. Hands off Lisa until after the election please!

nothing says transparent like the need for an official information request. Hopefully Lisa follows Lewers out the door

Reminds me of the time a cosy little group tried to sell off Wanaka Airport. The only survivor from that debacle was Theelen though I have no idea why.

I think its clear that whatever situation happens that suits this council they hide behind rules knowing long time frames are involved... and then ignore the rules if it suits them its almost comical.. time is short now for swaying voters with Facebook lol...transparency and honestly is what everyone need to vote for!

Is there anything that can be done officially to force the new CE appointment to be put on hold until after the elections? If not, will the new CE have a 90 day trial period?

As a rate payer no way should Lisa Guy be involved in selecting the new CEO with 0 just in her performance.

The process is not transparent- we know next to nothing about it and even councillors can’t get hold of the procurement plan… let alone a blow by blow account of who did what when.
Yes, staff would have been able to approve the recruitment contract - that’s not because we gave Mike a specific delegation to sign off on these CE- related processes but because we failed to add them as a specific exclusion to his broad delegation. That needs to change.
As for the suggestion that they’re following the LGNZ guidance… it’s the full Council that should be following it - not staff. And if they were following the best practice guidance from the Office of the Auditor General, they would know that.
If staff had run their proposed process past councillors, we wouldn’t be in this situation. The question is why didn’t they? And why didn’t the Mayor or other members of the Committee let us know what they were doing?
For a Mayor who talks a big game about transparency, this proves it’s all talk.

Niki Gladding - you are dead right Auditor Generals advice and guidance would be best practice -AND common sense says it's a caretaker administration at this point , so you leave anything as important as a CE appointment to the new administration

Niki Gladding the Au/nz international standards for risk management seems to be the reference material for central yet I haven’t seen it referenced in local governments and am awaiting oia from AG office, do you know the CE job description and required qualifications? does the CE require risk management qualms/experience? From an outside view, risk management failure seems to be what lead to the emergency release as the risk wasn’t communicated sufficiently until mitigated to avoid risk of release. You attempted to communicate esculated risks and then that unfolded, which is why it seems that risk management qualifications and experience is an essential requirement of a CE to ensure they are a suitable qualified and experienced person? I was seeking this info. To know where it can be written into policy and planning please?

Amanda McHolm I agree - risk management needs to improve significantly across the organisation. The systems are improving, but slowly (possibly due to limited resources), and I'm concerned that while some of the risk structures may appear improved, risk practice hasn't - at least not 'across the board'. Obviously some people and departments will do better than others. Risk management of the Shotover Disposal Field - certainly at the Governance level - was abysmal to non-existant. Given that the risk wasn't escalated as it should have been, I think the same could be said of management's performance. Bigger Picture - the treatment of the risk of 'Ineffective Governance' (it's in the register) has been terrible (in my opinion). Risk management is included in the current CE position description but almost as an afterthought; that can be, and should be, strengthened, through the recruitment process. Risk management could also be brought into the CE's KPIs so they filter down to the staff's job descriptions and KPIs as a stronger focus. In terms of governance, I think the Audit and Risk Committee's terms of reference (TOR) need to explicitly require deep dives into key issues including how the risk was treated, and how the system and behaviours let ratepayers down. A strong connection to the full Council should also be written into the AFRC's TOR - at the moment the Committee and the Council don't 'talk'. I guess what I'm saying is that we could, and probably should, recruit for better risk management but we also need to improve skills, experience, and practice at the governance level.

Niki Gladding ultimately the standards guide offers effective risk management framework and policy. How can this be implemented in a timely manner? Would it be of service to the regions rate payers to have an independent Risk Assesor and communicator role separate from CE to ensure transparency and that the risk/s are communicated. I would see this role also being of service to the town planning/duty planners via cumulative risks (including natural hazards that are falling between the central/regional/local council cracks and this risk being assessed in accurate and ever changing context as per the standards guidelines, seeking independent professionals, such as GNS scientists, to meet risk management and mitigation gaps that require a level of expertise that may not be address in applicant resource management consents and in context of the fast-track and rma. We have many skilled safety auditors in this region and switching from assessing outdoor risk to geotechnical is likely an easy transition for some. The “fix it” service with a bit of risk management guidance could offer a means of public to communicate risk/s to the role to develop a QLDC safe operations plan and within this could also be workplace H&S for psychological harms to ensure quality staff retention as it seems the staffing is in fairly high rotation which costs the rate payer. I’m still awaiting OIA from QLDC on the cumulative risk of liquifaction from the hundreds of soakpits added to mitigate stormwater (many over aquafier/unmapped groundwater systems) as with the intentions to add major infrastructure like the wanaka airport, how the developer-council induced individual geotech and stormwater designs don’t seem to have been reassessed regionally for interactions yet historically because there hasn’t been a risk of liquefaction, it isn’t being given weight by the independent report writers. As such, it seems appointing an risk mitigation position would be a means of QLDC mitigating the risk of not having a independent risk assessor. With this role including the development of the risk communication and education/upskilling in-house as well as aligning common stakeholders risk planning. Hiring an independent consultant for the purpose may be too costly and ineffective which is why creating a role for the purpose is where I went with it… Would this be a feasible option of approach? If so, how does that happen? Ideally prior to the new CE being appointed.
