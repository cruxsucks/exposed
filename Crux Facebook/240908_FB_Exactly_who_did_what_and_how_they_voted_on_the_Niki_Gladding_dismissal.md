This needs to be shared as much as possible. I now know who exactly I'll be voting for, and who I won't!!!.

Is it true that Lewyers is in line to be the next CEO of Skyline Enterprises?

Was Niki financially penalised by being removed from the committees?

Dallas Jones yes. The QLDC edited the full coverage of the meeting. Which was a big disappointment and shows they can't be trustedü§ê

So they effectively ‚Äúsacked‚Äù someone the ratepayers voted in. The only one doing what we want, being honest and keeping us informed.

So really only Quentin and Esther had any sense of what was the morally correct action by Nikki when QLDC started pouring faecal matter into the Shotover River.

They‚Äôve been bullying Nikki for years. Anyone who went against Theelan gets dumped.

Sharyn Mathias I think council staff who made the call needed to front this as planned, they were wanting to speak with ORC and Iwi first before Niki shared it so ultimately didn‚Äôt get the chance to. You can‚Äôt ask for qldc to be better if you don‚Äôt give it the chance to. Niki still holds her role and responsibilities in full council just not on committees (which decisions have to be passed by full council anyway) so she still has ultimate voting rights regardless. That‚Äôs my why

Cody Tucker you were fresh back from China which was to do with your new business venture and just became a yes man for Glynn. You also were complaining about the travel for meeting's, how much time was needed for the QLDC work and very little pay. So is it right for you to be running again?? We have some very keen New candidates running this election, who will give it everything they can too get the change we are all after.

Crux do you have footage of the Embarrassing Barry Bruce Rant? That kind of behaviour needs to be seen by voters before the election

Niki Gladding
In defense of the councillors (including Cody), the Report (requisitioned by Glyn) was seriously flawed and did not explain to those without a good grasp of the Code and democracy, why they should follow the correct process. But if they didn't know, should they be in governance positions?? Part of a councillors' job is to hold the executive to account. To do that job they have to be capable of accepting that the executive can get things wrong. And that sometimes that might be intentional.

That was awful to watch. Such bullying. Completely unnecessary.
