Well, that‚Äôs an interesting CV.
Interested to know what all the Democracy Services staff do ‚Ä¶ ? Do they have other communications roles or whatever?

Notwithstanding that a number of people employed by the QLDC appear to have very flexible and hybrid work schedules ,based on work,life balance considerations. It would be interesting to ascertain if any of these emails were compiled during ,what are considered normal working hours?

Today is world democracy day, has anyone seen it around lately? Today I have ticked John Glover as mayor, say thanks to the people standing up for change and hopefully Lewer‚Äôs time is over, together with any unnecessary staff spending money where they shouldn‚Äôt.

How can anyone work with Sewers after what he is done in the ruination of Queenstown over the last three years?

This is a stark change since three years ago, when a one-day-a-week QLDC staff member was told by QLDC senior management that they must delete their ‚Äòlike‚Äô of a post I made during the election. Their ‚Äòlike‚Äôwas on their personal Facebook account, and my post was not pro or anti any candidate. They were told unequivocally that all QLDC staff must remain apolitical during the election campaign and neither make comments nor like any political posts. So what has changed and why since then?

Cath Gilmour that is correct, no Council staff member is supposed to comment or become involved in election campaigns, regardless of their personal preferences..

Totally, totally unprofessional. I thought there was a Local Government rule against staff being involved directly with the elections from one month out from Election Day.

QLDC Senior Staff are obviously morally bankrupt individuals with no ethical integrity or any sort of respect for the people of the electorate by allowing that to occur.

Kenneth Russell His CV would be a bunch of lies anyhow! But after many years with his face firmly in the public trough, both in Queenstown and Christchurch he probably won‚Äôt even need another job!
