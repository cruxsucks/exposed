**Post Content:**
Councillor Lisa Guy voted in favour of taking QLDC's water services to an external organisation - against 75% of public submissions. But months earlier her family business - Rationale - had provided paid advice to QLDC's mayor and management on the same subject. The Auditor-General says she should not have voted - and Mayor Lewers had to use his casting vote to push the move through. So does the vote now have to be taken again? Plus we reveal 2025 QLDC candidate Stephen Brent is the lawyer acting as trustee to Lisa Guy's Rationale shares.

A good family friend who was a very respected journalist, and who edited the Evening Post in Wellington for many years used to say, "believe half of what you hear and none of what you read". In other words, never take anything at face value.
I have been fairly critical of this current council and some of its councilors in the past. And I have had questions about Lisa Guy. Some based on her voting record and others based on stories from Crux and conversations with other people in our community.
What I would urge everyone to remember is that we never really know the full story and that some journalists sometimes have a Jack Russell type tendency to try and make thigh bones out of tidbits of scraps.
This week, I decided to take my questions directly to the source and had a sit down with Lisa. I'm a great believer in asking questions before leaping to conclusions. We have crossed paths a bit over the last few months especially during the UIV hearings in Arrowtown.
After having a really honest and frank discussion with Lisa and doing a bit of my own homework and some serious reflecting, I have reached my own conclusions and decided that I am still going to support Lisa this election.
That is not to say that I took everything she told me on complete trust. Nor am I convinced that she has voted the way I would have expected or wanted her to around the council table. BUT, everyone deserves a second chance and I personally don't believe all the insinuations about corruption that have been leveled against her. And I have a fairly good radar for that kind of thing. You'll just have to take my word for it on this but I have sniffed out a few rotten apples in my time.
I would like to see Lisa improve her engagement with her constituency. And if she is voted back in, it is my intention to work alongside her to help her do just that.
I would also add, that I believe that there is more than a faint aroma of Kool Aid about some of this journalist's articles. And, I am beginning to suspect, a hidden agenda of his own. Or at least a serious case of confirmation bias.

Christina Dawson it‚Äôs important that you detail exactly what is wrong with our story - please detail that for us. This is essential as if you believe Lisa Guy then you must have some evidence to disbelieve Crux. We have no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness - so you must be saying that the QLDC, in spite of our reporting, has never lied to us and does not deserve the 17% - or more accurately 4% - trust rating in their own community survey? We are really looking forward to working with a new council where positive stories can be told and we can actually believe what the council comms team and all councillors tell us. That should a a given - not something new and novel.

Crux there are so many assumptions in your response that I don't know where to start. Therein, I believe, is the problem. As you should well know, the world is far more nuanced and less black and white than we would like.

Christina Dawson When you say "you'll just have to take my word for it on this" you are perpetuating one of the main problems with the current council, mayor, and councillors like Lisa. Why should the electorate just have to believe the insiders?

Ian Moore I get it. But there simply isn't a public record of those instances for me to "lean in to". If you choose not to believe me, then that's absolutely your right. Also, I'm not at all an "insider" and never wish to be. I want to be part of the solution. And that's all.
And I do agree. People should never "have" to believe anyone. That's a matter of personal choice.

Christina Dawson it is always good to get a balanced view to make your own assessment. Thank you for delving into this a little deeper. I know Lisa's family and believe them to have the best interests of the community at heart. We can't always agree with everything others do if we don't have the full facts. Crux of course is working to provide those, but some things are still subjective. I am not eligible to vote in Arrowtown, but would give Lisa another shot.

Christina Dawson Anyone who is in Lewers, Theelan camp, in my opinion is not to be trusted. I may no longer live in Arrowtown, I did however vote for Lisa last time, and regret it! Conflicts of interest should always be declared . That to me indicates she is NOT transparent, honest in this instance . Therefore she should remove herself from the race.

Sandi Mulholland I hear you. I haven't been their biggest fan either. But I'm beginning to think that there may not be the level of corruption behind certain goings on that some would have us believe. There's so much crap flying around though, it can be hard to know what's what. Regardless of that, I think there need to be some major changes at council. Mike Theelan resigning is a good thing. And I think we need a new mayor. I read Crux a lot. And I'm grateful for their work. But I don't necessarily believe everything I read, whether its from them or any other media source. Whatever the truth of it, the relationship between Council and community isn't great. And that should be a primary focus of the next council and CEO. Question everything is my motto.

Sandi Mulholland actually, it sounds like Christina has delved deeply into the issue and formed a reasoned opinion. She has clearly looked at both sides of the story, something I urge everyone to do when voting. That doesn't mean either camp is necessarily right or wrong (or doesn't make mistakes), it just means Christina has decided to back the best candidate from those standing based on all the facts. I applaud her for doing her due diligence.

Christina Dawson investigative journalism in NZ has been defunded to the point of extinction.
Yes, there are many sides to every story, but when those who are meant to be representing the community are being secretive and obstructive it is good to make the information public.
These people are seeking a mandate to make decisions on our behalf for the next 3 years. We have a right to know about them.
Pretty much anyone without a serious criminal conviction can stand for local government. No vetting occurs. Crux is helping uncover conflicts of interest and past behaviours that the rest of us don't have the time or connections to do.
This is important work. The more they protest the more suspicious I become.

Mary Teresa you're absolutely right. Crux are doing important work. And they have highlighted some very important concerns. I also believe that political journalism is a bit of a dark art so I also question everything I read. Which is why I decided that I needed to talk to Lisa in person. And I didn't walk away like some disciple either. The fact is, I didn't know her that well at all. After we spoke, I decided to give her another chance. And that's pretty much it.

I feel this conversation is really about integrity. A link to paid information from a family business interest about a topic coming up for vote might not be immediately noticed by anyone else, but to Lisa it should have been obvious that it could be seen as a conflict of interest. At the very least, she should have sought advice before the vote. If she did, from whom and what was it? If she didn't.... did that demonstrate integrity? Actions speak louder than words.

If Lisa should have declared a conflict, Theelan and Sewers would both have known this. So if it is true, this would be yet another example of the two of them operating outside of the Local Government Rules to get what they want.

Corruption all over, & probably just the tip of the iceberg, corruption is a cancer that if you don't cut it from the roots and everything that touched, it will just keep spreading and rotting the system.
Great work from the investigators and the team who is behind this article, they are brave enough to go deep into the sewer of the Corrupted Council and uncover this type of disgusting situations. More information like this should be spread, so we can take the right direction on the next election.
