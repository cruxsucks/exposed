Too bloody right, John. Good on you! And this has tipped me from being unsure between Darren and yourself for my vote for a more progressive mayor. You've got my vote - am always impressed when people stand up for what is right.

Lewers is not operating alone. All three of the people concerned should be removed from office and held accountable. It is time for change. Make your votes count

Could not agree more. Let‚Äôs hope you have the opportunity to enact your proposed approach to recruitment of the CEO.

Spot on John.
Surely totally outside of his remit with just three weeks to go, especially in such a behind closed doors manner.
This smells of a man in desperation, continuing his sojourn of nepotism, with total disregard for all elected councillors bar his ‚Äúelite‚Äù three. Not to mention his constituents !

This is totally unacceptable - the new mayor and council should be responsible for appointing a new CEO!

To learn from lessons of the past you have to acknowledge their was issues I think that the mayor and his mate sat in the sane table of non transparent ineptitude‚Ä¶ and his try to recruit raises major concerns when your position is listening g to your rate payers.

Folks, Lewers knows he's going down, and is going to do everything he can to leave behind a legacy of crap for QLDC to deal with just for spite.

Kenneth Russell bad idea if you ‚ÄúACTUALLY ‚Äúcare about your community and want to hold your head up when you leave office, ask yourself Glyn , is this what‚Äôs best for Queenstown/wanaka / lakes district ??ü§¶üèª
You are becoming the Jacinda Ardern Pariah of the Queenstown lakes district . Do the right thing and bow out gracefully mate .
