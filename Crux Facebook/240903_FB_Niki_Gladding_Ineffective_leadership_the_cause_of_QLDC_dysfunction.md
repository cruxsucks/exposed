Restoring community trust in council must be a council priority
I think you’ve been outstanding in your past efforts to communicate with the community and your commitment to good process despite its personal cost
In short you’ve earned the communities trust and support

Here's my challenge: dysfunction is subjective. I presume, the majority of councillors think everything is wonderful as there seems to be a majority consensus with decision making. Apparent dysfunction is a product of incompetence, weakness and hidden agendas and maybe that is what is meant and is something I'd agree with. What worries me is the people who are elected or put into leadership roles simply aren't up to the job. How a majority of councillors can sit around the table and give the thumbs up to the Shitover River feels, to me, as "dysfunctional" but not apparently to the council. Alternatively, maybe, the sane and capable are simply in the minority. If the leadership was ineffective, Sewers wouldn't want to be relected but I suspect he thinks he the bee's knees.

one of the best candidate interviews I have read thus far. Niki's responses show a deep level of thought and rather than the empty sound bites so many other candidates have offered, she provides real answers and solutions to problems around transparency, accounability and comms. Perhaps most of all, I like her statement that democracy and the community come first, ahead of her own ideology, and I feel there is a track record there to prove that.

John Cossens I agree with you John, she has had to put up with being targeted by the bully Lewers and his cronies but she is still standing strong. I believe she will always put the community first, and has no “hidden” agenda, which is not something that can be said about all councillors, council staff, or management .

A straight shooter. Intelligent. Considered. Empathetic. Team player. Bold. Thick skinned. All the best Niki.
