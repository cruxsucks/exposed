As a recruiter (who wants no part in this process) we would agree the scope of the work and process required with the client, at the same time as agreeing the contract. This is for pricing reasons. I'm not sure how you can confirm a recruiter, without doing this and still remain fiscally responsible. Sorry, but something feels completely off with this process. Even in an executive search and selection basis, you generally agree the fees based on 1/3 upfront, 1/3 at shortlisting, and 1/3 on a successful offer. So, what exactly had been agreed and on what terms?

The question I want to know, is why did they undertake this process this close to the election, what reasoning was used to start the process that they might not be able to finish.
Why, is now the correct time to start.
I donâ€™t care about the conjecture of both sides. I do care as to why there is no policy on CEO recruitment, but I want to know why they love started this process.

Craig Gasson if they were following guidance or policy, or not as another says isnâ€™t the question is it.
Itâ€™s why now, why not leave it to the next council.
I believe three years ago, we had similar decision making rushed through, didnâ€™t some of our councillors and mayor complain when they got into the chambers that they could have waited?

What we might need is a short term interim specialist "turn around" CEO which is prepared to enact with no fear or favour .One who is prepared to do a root and Branches review and clear out .In effect lay the ground for a longer term incumbent.

Crux thank you for continuing to ask the hard questions. But I think it is now also the time to ask mayoral aspirants and councillors that if elected what are they going to do with the cabal of senior managers who have enthusiastically enacted the ideology of their CEO and mayor over many, many years. The CEO and mayor may well be gone but that still leaves the foot soldiers who enforced a culture of lack of transparency, honesty and at every turn sought to withhold information. They have a disdain and contempt for ratepayers and seemingly think they are unaccountable. I donâ€™t see how they can hold their jobs under a new regime if it is to be open and transparent. The likes of Avery, Wallace, Miller, Crosby-Roe. I am sure there are others, these people need to go and saying they just did what they were told is not a reason to keep them. If they stay they will simply be a handbrake on the new council and soon revert to their old tricks and undermine the new mayor and councillors.

John Cossens It's well documented that when there is a big change at the top of any organisation a lot of previously powerful staff realise their power base is gone - and leave. So it all comes down to the election outcome. Employment law on the other hand is complex.

I sincerely hopes so but they have failed to read the room thus far and seem aloof to all of this. So it will be up to Mayor and councillors to push for change.

Crux And thereâ€™s not just change coming via CE Recruitment and elections. RM reform, the Water CCO, and the removal of â€˜the wellbeingsâ€™ from the LG purpose statement, all point to a restructure, probable redundancies, and new positions to advertise. Big change is coming. Iâ€™m just wondering how the recruitment process has captured that.

Hi All, please read the article - I believe the headline inaccurately represents what Matt Wong actually said on LinkedIn

Sewers is behaving publicly how he behaves in council behind closed doors. We are all just able to watch it in our own time.
More and more Councillors will show their hand in the next 2 weeks.
Oh how the squeaky clean images fall.

Lewers needs to be hands off this whole process as he wont be mayor next month! Guy needs to stand back too with her conflict of interest from benefitting from council contracts. The whole lot are dodgy as

All of the concern and confusion (and the trading of blows) would have been avoided if the staff and councillors had an agreed policy to follow - for both CE recruitment and performance review. The LGNZ document that QLDC and the Mayor keep referring to provides a helpful 11 step 'guide' but it doesn't set out who should take which step when. And it must be used alongside the guidance provided by the OAG - and other LGNZ guidance about making decisions in the election period. Our experiences shape our views. Many councillors around the table have never been through a Council CE recruitment process - they may have employed many staff, and used, or even been, recruiters for private companies. That might cause them to be relaxed about the appointment of a recruiter. But local government is not the private sector. I asked Chat GPT to compare the law, best practice, and risks around appointing a recruiter in the 2 contexts - for local government and for a private company. It's produced a handy table that I can't attach directly. But the summary is as follows:
"In the private sector, appointing a recruitment agency is a discretionary, internal decision of the board, carrying mainly commercial risk. In contrast, for councils the appointment of a recruitment agency is a governance decision of consequence: it sets the foundation for the CE recruitment process and directly affects perceptions of fairness, impartiality, and legitimacy. Because OAG and LGNZ guidance emphasise that the process must give all elected members confidence, limiting councillor involvement in selecting the recruiter creates legal, reputational, and political risks that can undermine the eventual CE appointment. The safest and most defensible approach is to treat the recruitment agency appointment as a full council decision, conducted transparently, and documented with clear criteria and conflict management."
