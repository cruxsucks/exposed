As a previous board member of Shaping our Future I can confirm that the claims of John getting paid by QLDC are nonsense.
As a previous board member, Barry knows this.
I can also confirm that John was an excellent member of SOF and was the only paid member in his role as executive secretary. He was employed by and paid by SOF. Ôøº
He did a great job and would, I am sure, be an excellent mayor. He certainly has the skills base and the experience.

Crux what are you talking about? There is no mystery what he has been doing. Have you not seen the graph which shows his voting alignment with Lewers? He is in pole position - he is the most aligned with Lewers on voting.

If John Glover is our next Mayor and Bazza gets back on Council, that'll be awkward!

Was this the councilor who had his part in a council meeting edited out because it was so unhinged? Only people in the room got to hear it. Would have been great for the community to see that for transparency.

Bit predictable. Hold your line John Glover for Mayor ‚úÖ, professional as usual.
Although watching from over Central Otago‚Äôs fence üëÄ, have vested interest in this election outcome ‚Ä¶...üíØsupport for you.

Is the back-hand club getting a little nervous someone who‚Äôs ‚Äòfor the people‚Äô might actually get the top spot? ü§îüçø The joys of the internet, these comments are super revealing.

Firstly, who? Secondly, is this someone who is trying to make themselves relevant!? If I was trailing that badly in the polls, I'd be desperately trying to appear competent.

Barry is only there for the money. Completely invisible and never had an opinion on anything until now - and it's vile.

Hey Crux, how about an article which researches then reveals, 'The many ways that now desperate Lewers is trying to screw the election'. If of course there were many examples...

Barry talks absolute nonsense! By this definition, any organisation who receives funding from QLDC works for QLDC - which is ridiculous. My organisation gets help from QLDC for events, should I now list QLDC as my employer?
