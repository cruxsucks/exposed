A question for anyone able to answer. How many recruitment companies exist in NZ with the requisite expertise to recruit for a CEO position in local government? I don't imagine that there are many. I ask this because that may be a limiting factor when shortlisiting recruitment agencies.
The appointment of a CEO is a really important role for the council and I agree with Councillor Gladding and others that transparency of process is important. That said, there will inevitably be privacy matters that mean that full disclosure of all the facts are sometimes not possible or legally safe.
It would be useful for the public to know what those privacy matters are (minus the detail obviously).
In other words, if there's stuff you can't tell us, at least tell us why.

Christina Dawson you raise a very good point. CEO headhunters are a very different beast from recruiters of general staff. They are mutually exclusive and it is a huge concern that a recruiter from the QLDC panel has been appointed to recruit a CEO.. They will likely to be very biddable toward a candidate already identified by the .mayor and CEO.

Christina Dawson there are a lot of recruitment agencies experienced in senior local govt recruitment appointment: Sheffield, Beyond, Hobson Leavy and Jackson Stone (to name a few few). I understand the latter was engaged.

Christina Dawson LGNZ provide a CE recruitment service through EQUIP. Extensive experience, advisory support for the beginning stages of the process available (the steps that have already happened here) and maybe even a more competitive price.

John Glover for Mayor
Multiple people have asked me today where I stand on the two very significant QLDC issues highlighted by Crux in the news this weekend.
The first is concerning the potential problems with the vote of Council to establish the Council-Controlled Organisation (CCO) for our water services delivery, and the second is re the irregularities with the recruitment of our next CEO.
Both issues are very serious indeed. They go to the heart of governance and public confidence in Council.
Both issues will have significant, costly, long-lasting impacts for ratepayers and the QLDC, including legal - costs which ultimately fall on ratepayers.
For this reason, in the middle of the election, I am absolutely clear that Council should hit "pause" on both, effective immediately.
I asked this of council a week ago for the CEO recruitment. That is the only responsible course of action at this time.
I've been very clear that good governance, following best practice (including advice from the Office of the Auditor General), and operating Council with maximum transparency (including financial) are all key to turning QLDC around.
Under my leadership, this is how Council will move forward. These principles are non-negotiable and absolutely key to good local democracy.
I've previously shared my more detailed thoughts around delegations, official information, finances and more - you can see these on my John Glover for Mayor page.
If I have the honour of being elected as your new Mayor, I will lead a collaborative, inclusive, strong Council which listens to our community, does its business without excluding the public and gets better outcomes for our district.
There may be more to say about this very soon, but for now QLDC must hit pause.

So using a non existant financial authority does that mean that fraud has been committed?

Thanks again Niki Gladding for shedding light on this. I hope you do make that complaint. They need to be held accountable.

Apart from what seems to be an embedded culture of disingenuous behaviour within both the political and executive arms of QLDC, the real concern is that this constant turmoil distracts from the efficient management of Council’s day-to-day business. Ultimately, it’s costing ratepayers money and services.
The sooner those responsible are held accountable—or fall on their sword—the better off we will all be.

I'm actually lost for words about all of this. It all appears so dodgy and underhand. If Lewers signed this before even telling councillors of Theelen's resignation, doesn't have financial authority but signed as if he does, and has been driving this process in secret, he should stand down and pull out of the election. This is so bad.
Even worse, the bullying language he used in his post the other day when talking about Niki G was just disgusting. And his references to "misinformation", "Mayoral Candidates" doing the "wrong thing". I would go over and comment, but I've been blocked because I raised a legitimate question on his facebook post a couple of weeks ago, and was respectful. He blocked me because he didn't want to answer an inconvenient question, and didn't want people to see my question. Talk about lack of leadership.

Unbelievable audacity from Lewers and others who think this type of behaviour is OK. Thank you Niki Gladding for acting on your concerns.

Finally after his years of filling his own pockets at our expense ceo Theelen has done something that’s actually in the best interests of Queenstown and resigned. No doubt there’s a big severance payout for ratepayers to fork out though.

Can you imagine the complete dismay of his financiers and supporters?….they must be absolutely devastated to have supported someone who refuses to work within his remit or for the benefit of the stakeholders of his employer, and then just lies and insults anyone who points this out.
