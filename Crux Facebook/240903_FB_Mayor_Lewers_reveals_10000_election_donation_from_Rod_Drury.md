I would be very surprised if he can get back in - it would certainly top Jesus rising from the dead. I think that Theelan can see the writing on the wall and is bailing.

So the public need to mobilise behind one alternative candidate to make sure he doesn't get back in.

Guess who authored the regional deal AND was first to present it to councillors?
Answer: Ross Copland. Ross works for and is a director of Southern Infrastructure Limited. The other directors are the CEO of Rod Drury’s family office, Jenna Adamson, and Rod Drury’s nominee company.

Rod is attached to 2 private projects that sit within the Regional Deal. If Glyn's been given $10 000 by Rod because Rod's a supporter of the Regional Deal, doesn't Glyn have a conflict going forward? Would he really be able to sit on the Joint (tri-council) Committee which will oversee negotiations? Wouldn't his financial attachment to Rod raise questions about his decisions? This is particularly concerning because the Committee operates by consensus - so Glyn could block a vote with a single 'nay'.

Niki Gladding - if he wins the election, I think he'd have to recuse himself from any discussions that relate to Rod's projects. Otherwise that conflict would definitely cause trust issues with the public.
