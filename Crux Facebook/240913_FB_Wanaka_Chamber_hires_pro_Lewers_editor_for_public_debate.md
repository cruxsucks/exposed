Crux is reviewing our ability to cover the Tuesday candidate debate in Wānaka after discovering that the Chamber of Commerce has hired the pro-Lewers Editor of the Mountain Scene as moderator. The Queenstown local paper benefits from over $200,000 of QLDC advertising spend each year and has ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview.

Why wasn't someone from the Upper Clutha invited to moderate?

The Crux poster of "Who funds my campaign" chart would be a good starting point for the debate.

Isn’t Katie Bradford the Strategy and Engagement manager for Infrastructure New Zealand?

Crux I wouldn’t have thought that Infrastructure New Zealand would be interested in a degrowth lens for example. At the very least it should have been clearly stated that Katie has a paid role with an organisation currently.

Rachel Rose Their mission is to fix the infrastructure deficit - but we see your point, they advocate for infrastructure suppliers. But we saw no evidence of bias in her approach to the Queenstown debate - in fact she seemed to enjoy being back in her strong journalism persona.

None of this is surprising. The chair of chamber is on the payroll at council's airport company, and is something like head of infrastructure so would be in charge of the development of Wanaka airport when that happens. Cosy cosy.

Be interesting to understand the chairman’s relationship with Lewers and Mountain scene
Something stinks

The sooner we disband this QLDC regime from top to bottom, the better.
The outrageous uncontrolled spending and ongoing recruitment of unnecessary bureaucrats has to be brought to a halt.
Nepotism comes to mind !!

If this and Rod Drury’s behavior doesn’t shout “Sewers cannot get back in under his own merit, and we are going to do our damndest to stay/get on the gravy train”, I don’t know how else they could be more obvious about it.
Speak up Wanaka!
Don’t be a pawn in their selfish games.

The Chamber in both Queenstown and Wanaka are both creatures of the Big End of Town who Overtly and Covertly support the current incumbent.

Queenstown needs objective journalism not more spin, bad things happen when good men do nothing, Mayoral Candidates please object to this manipulation and demand transparency and democracy, otherwise you will get to the next election and QT will still stink literally and metaphorically!

Steve Dixon pretty mind boggling indeed and it took me ages… normally one just doesn’t expect such undemocratic behaviour, or should I say illegal shenanigans covered up in the most devious ways?
