In this opinion/commentary piece councillor Niki Gladding says that Mayor Lewers is already active in recruiting a new QLDC CEO - using a committee that includes Lisa Guy and Lyal Cocks. But is this best practice? She thinks not.

Thank you Nikki for being brave enough to write this piece. What a mess the council is in! All the best for the election - we need you on council again, hopefully with a strong mayor and new councillors without agendas. üëèüëè

Is he hoping the new CE can have a casting vote on who is the mayor?

Given that our democratic right to elect a new Council and Mayor to make decisions on our behalf for the next three years, was less than month away, I do not believe Glyn personally had the mandate to commit a process which is so critical to the direction which our newly elected council may wish to take.

These idiots want us to reelect them. They‚Äôve promised ‚Äútransparency‚Äù, ‚Äú a better relationship with us‚Äù
Sewers has shown us all that not one of them speaks the truth, they are all in his pocket allowing him/not stopping him from doing this.

I've put a question to some of the candidates asking: a) their involvement in the process which I'm guessing none, b) establishing confidence that any one offered the role is suitable c) their process and response if they arent. You'd think that no offers would be extended until the results are confirmed and that the winner having a final say in the the appointee.

This must be left to the incoming council so that we can reset expectations and requirements without the baggage of the status quo.

No. The Council's entered a contract. But the recruiter could presumably be hauled into the room and redirected if that's necessary. The direction provided to them may be fantastic - the point is we have no idea and it should have been all of us around the table from the 'get go'

Niki Gladding it doesn‚Äôt matter what his intentions allegedly are Niki. The Mayor has no right to do this. As I understand it he is not polling well, so why is he making future decisions for us.

Niki Gladding if the contract was concluded without clear delegated authority and possibly outside of the Council‚Äôs Procurement Policy, could an argument perhaps be made that the contract is, in fact, void? This recruitment assignment would be eagerly sought by any credible HR company and will be lucrative too. Who decided on the three companies to make a bid? Is there a clear paper trail for the execution of the contract? It‚Äôs always the Watergate question - who knew what and when.

Ian Hall I don‚Äôt think so. From memory there‚Äôs a section in the LGA that protects against ultra vires decisions undermining contracts. If the Committee made the decision it would be ultra vires. But it may be that staff made the decision and used the Committee for guidance and undertaking the assessment and so on. Staff have various financial sub delegations under Mike‚Äôs broad delegation. I‚Äôm just wondering if the law allows Mike to make any financial decisions in relation to cE recruitment. If not, staff can‚Äôt have a sub delegation. And again the decision would be ultra vires. The appointment of a CE can‚Äôt be delegated to a CE. Whether that extends to the rest of the process is unclear. We can‚Äôt delegate the decision on the LTP but obviously staff do the rest.
I think the answer is to ensure we alter the CE‚Äôs broad financial delegation to exclude all matters to do with performance reviews and CE recruitment. So the full council makes all those decisions

Niki Gladding well, I‚Äôll defer to your much greater knowledge but it‚Äôs disappointing that such a crucial decision should have commenced in a notably untidy manner.

Ian Hall we‚Äôll be taking a very close look at this - the tragedy and the scandal of this is that QLDC will make us wait 20 days - until after the election - but we‚Äôll also ask Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor direct.

Ian Hall Your disappointment is justified. I‚Äôm disgusted. I‚Äôve been asking for staff to lay out their suggested process for this since the start of the year and they‚Äôve basically ignored me.

Meanwhile the PR reaction is being considered‚Ä¶
A/ Acknowledge it‚Äôs not right but that it‚Äôs not your fault. Stand back at a distance and get out the ‚Äúblamethrower‚Äù. Can we say this was the previous councils fault?
B/ Say that the other Mayoral candidates don‚Äôt understand how council works. Be confident we‚Äôre in the right. Threaten defamation to any challenge.
C/ Frame this as simply ‚Äútransparency leakage‚Äù. Yeah, leakage tested better than loss remember.
D/ Deflect and talk about the regional deal. We can flog that for another few weeks surely.

Excuse me, but what authority does Lewers hold to undertake this action and with election less than a month away, and the current CEO in place until February 2026, a new CEO should only be appointed after the election.

There's a lot of corruption inside our district and government. We should start to reshape how we do politics in NZ, starting from our district. Which kind of democracy is it? How do we ended giving so much power for those who clearly have no preparation to lead us?
How many candidates for the new term have proposed a new way to change this? We are going to replace 6 for half dozen to keep destroying our district for another 3 years, it's unbelievable üò≥

I should also have added that using the Performance Review Committee to recruit is not just a problem because it has no delegation from the Council... it's also the only committee we have that doesn't allow councillors to sit in on meetings. We don't get the meeting invites, we don't get the documents (agendas, attachments, minutes). It's very 'secret squirrel'. So it's the least transparent vehicle for making decisions. To me we should have agreed a procurement plan for that recruiter in public. Then the lousy advice we get (just my opinion) around CE processes might start to improve.
