I've been in favour of this for years. It's time councils were made to live within a budget like the rest of us.

We need rates capping regardless on whether the councils like it or not. They need to spend money according to their budget not budget according to how much money they force rate payers to pay. Im not sure about all councillors nationwide but what I've read, some councillors and especially mayor's on are on huge salaries.

He would say that, after all our money he and his minions have spent, and want to keep on spending. Interesting that reading all the canditates blurbs for election, I haven't been able to see any one that says in black and white "I agree with a rates cap". So, people, what do we do?

A rates cap is quite extreme but if this is what it takes to make Council drive value from their spending bring it on. A measure of the spend up culture at QLDC was the staff head count increased during Covid.

The only "dumbest idea ever" was trying to hide a sewage problem from the public and then trying to silence Nikki for being honest. Hopefully we won't have to hear anymore of his dumb ideas soon
