Feeling somewhat nervous about this partnership . Especially when they talk about " other potential sources of income". Will the money get combined then given to Queenstown, to fix their f@#$k ups, given its seen as the Tourist Mecca?! 30yr strategy plan ðŸ¤¢. Irrespective of who may be sitting at the "top desk".
