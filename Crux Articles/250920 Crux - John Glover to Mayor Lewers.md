John Glover to Mayor Lewers: CEO recruitment "no mandate - optics terrible."

The following letter to Mayor Glyn Lewers and QLDC Councillors has been copied to Crux.

Dear Glyn and Councillors

I read with alarm this weekend confirmation from Niki Gladding that the recruitment process for the new CEO has been started without full involvement from sitting councillors. Even at the very early stage of the process, there is no good reason for this, there is no mandate for this, and the optics are terrible.

This appointment is probably the most important decision QLDC Councillors will make during the coming term, as you all well know. Council should follow best practice, and no part of the recruitment process should be unnecessarily secretive or exclusive to a select group of councillors.

Getting it right starts with getting the process right. To be considering, appointing or briefing recruiters in secret, behind closed doors, away from the Council table is simply not acceptable.

I am also concerned that if the process to date exceeds the authority/remit delegated to those involved, it leaves the Council potentially liable to Judicial Review proceedings and the significant and avoidable costs that would attract.


With only 21 days until the election result, I urge you to halt the process (including procurement of a recruiter, or providing any direction or brief to a possible recruiter) until the new Mayor and Council is in place. We can and should do this properly. We have time.

If I am Mayor of the next council, I will lead this process with all Councillors involved in key decisions, from the outset, with the emphasis on transparency and good process. I understand of course that some elements (such as decisions around remuneration) might have to take place in Public Excluded, because of employment considerations. But those Public Excluded elements should be the exception.

John Glover - QLDC Mayoral Candidate.
