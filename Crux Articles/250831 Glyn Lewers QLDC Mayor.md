Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor's Post

Over the past 48 hours there have been some stories on Crux that seem to suggest some sort of conspiracy about my election campaign team. I‚Äôd like to clear this up.
 ‚òëÔ∏è I am fortunate to have a number of individuals on my campaign team, who come from a range of community and cultural backgrounds. 
‚òëÔ∏è While a few are acting for me in a paid capacity, others choose to volunteer their support. These people are on the team because they believe in me, and know I have the right skills and experience to run the district on behalf of all ratepayers.   
‚òëÔ∏è Scope Communications is providing paid marketing communications support. I also have engaged a local videographer and a local social media professional to help me. 
‚òëÔ∏è Richard Thomas is not funding my campaign. Ann Lockhart is not my campaign manager, nor is she getting paid. 
‚òëÔ∏è I have a website that was already built and paid for, during my first mayoral campaign. I encourage you to take a look, as it's where I will be publishing my blogs:  www.glynlewers.nz 
‚òëÔ∏è I am grateful to have received donations already, which helps pay for my election promotion. 
‚òëÔ∏è I am a qualified structural engineer by profession, and have managed budgets for major infrastructure projects throughout my career. This means I am more than capable of managing a $30k (inclusive of GST) budget, which is what I am legally allowed to spend as per the Local Electoral Act 2001. 
‚òëÔ∏è Every council and mayoral candidate across Aotearoa New Zealand is entitled to spend money on campaign advertising and promotion. I won‚Äôt be the only candidate who has a team of paid and volunteer supporters around them and I‚Äôm sure my fellow candidates will attest, this support is crucial during the highs and lows of campaigning.
‚òëÔ∏è All my expenditure, and donations, will be disclosed through the appropriate channels (the Electoral Officer) ‚Äì just as every other candidate is required to do as per the Local Electoral Act 2001 at the conclusion of the election. 
‚òëÔ∏è It appears that Crux is suggesting there is some sort of conspiracy going on as part of its fixation with my campaign. Any suggestion that a) my election spend will be outside of the $30k (GST inclusive), b) that I offer rewards to people that volunteer for me or c) that there is something untoward going on with my campaign is untrue. 
‚òëÔ∏è Throughout this short campaign period, I look forward to continuing serving my district as your mayor and focusing on important community issues. 
It has been disappointing to hear about council candidates feeling shaken and threatened at recent town hall meetings due to the behaviour of some people in the audience. Every single candidate is putting themselves up for public service during this time. Divisive, disrespectful behaviour is unacceptable. Congratulations to everyone standing at this year‚Äôs election, I look forward to having constructive discussion with you all.

Can you tell us who exactly is funding your campaign Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor and address the other questions we‚Äôve put to your team - no answers - just legal threats. All we want are the facts - and we‚Äôll be sure to be asking exactly the same questions of the other main mayoral candidates. Who is in your team, what‚Äôs their role and what is the role of Richard Thomas if he‚Äôs not funding you?

Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor We'd prefer your answers to be on this platform, and open to the entire community - if you answer our questions (by email) we are obviously going to publish the answers. So - are you saying you won't answer these questions? Why not? Also there seem to be a whole range of new restrictions on your Facebook page - we are getting multiple complaints from people who have been refused access to your content for a variety of reasons - can you tell us what the restrictions and (new) rules are? Thank you üëç

Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor We sent these questions to Scope Communications on August 27 with a deadline of 12 noon August 28 - hoping for an answer on your behalf. No replies supplied. We agree that the answers should be direct from you - thank you - but we have had problems getting replies in the past. "Who is funding Scope Communications - what is the role of Richard Thomas - is Scope discounting their usual fees - who is producing video content and at what cost - why did Glyn Lewers not invite other local media and councillors as requested by Sam Stubbs at Simplicity for his recent rent to buy housing launch ? Mayor Lewers made what we understand to be a false claim in the previous 2022 campaign to Crux that Olivia Wensley was on a QLDC conflict of interest list - but it was then established (from CEO Theelen) that the list did not exist. What's your explanation for that episode ? What‚Äôs Lauren Prebble‚Äôs role in this campaign and why are all the likes on Glyn‚Äôs Facebook page from you (Scope) and Glyn‚Äôs family? "
