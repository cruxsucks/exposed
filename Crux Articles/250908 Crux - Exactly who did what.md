Crux readers have been asking in considerable numbers for exactly the role played by existing councillors and mayor Glyn Lewers in the removal of Niki Gladding from her QLDC committee roles for revealing the council's plan to discharge semi treated sewage into the Shotover River after denying for over six months that a problem existed.

The short answer is that only two councillors voted against the removal of Councillor Gladding - Quentin Smith and Esther Whitehead.

Lisa Guy was absent on approval leave.

Barry Bruce, Gavin Bartlett, Glyn Lewers, Craig Ferguson, Lyal Cocks, Melissa White, Matt Wong and Cody Tucker all voted in support of Councillor Gladding's removal.

Here's Crux full, unedited video of the actual the vote, including Mayor Lewers remarks.This video has not previously been published.  The sewage discharge into the Shotover River started the next day - with unanswered questions over the authenticity of the "clean/treated" water sample - QLDC said the supporting scientific evidence was either "lost or did not exist." (paywall removed September 8.)
