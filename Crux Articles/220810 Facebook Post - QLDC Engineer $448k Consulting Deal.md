**Story Update:** We have been in touch with Jostin Loke and discovered he is posting accusations against Crux in partnership with the fake profile Andrew Tumeke - who bears a striking resemblance to Andrew Tipene. Thanks to Mr Loke we have discovered that Mr Tipene/Tumeke did in fact paste the QLDC official logo onto his personal gmail account. Thanks to all of the genuine people who have posted genuine comments on this story. More to come.

I work in the industry and Andrew Tipene appears to milk money out of the council engineering approval process by pulling up lots of pedantic engineering RFIs and costs 3 times what it should. I understand he also consults to other councils as well.

What the @##@% is wrong with this council.. There needs to be criminal investigations as potential white collar crime..... Us rate payers are sick to the teeth from huge avoidable waste... lost court cases... council incompetence and next to no repercussions..... Little wonder less and less of us hard working tax payers aren't stepping up to join as councilors or elected representatives..... trust is gone....absolute Muppets....

**Reply to Phil Andrew:**

Phil Andrew well said. If there was even a feeble attempt at explaining why this amount of money needs to be spent on "friends of the council" or even why the work needs to be done at that price (whether a crony from council involved or not), we would probably be a bit more understanding. As it is, money spent on consultants, with what accountability on the result of said "consultation" maybe we would all be a bit more understanding of the need for this expenditure. Oh, the joy of not having a bottom line, and no need to report on the losses and lack of results.

Our rates don't do much for this town except feed these consultants

QLDC also added that they had carefully checked Mr Tipene's invoices and detailed time sheets, with the cost being invoiced on to people applying for QLDC building permits, reports or certificates.

So, the developers pay for his expertise

##### Reply from Jay Moore (to Monique Adele):
Monique Adele I like that they are checking this stuff, but $448k over this period which gets charged to the developers doesn't seem like much. Also I can't imagine there would have been a queue of Civil engineers to replace him

So this is what a clown car made out of a skip fire filled with used diapers looks like! Thanks, QLDC.

Normal behavior for alot of these entities, often the environment inside the workplace is toxic and working from home becomes standard. See it in the sth too.

Interestingly these consulting amounts consistently seem to be in the 400-500k mark (also happens to be almost the entire annual budget for all of our elected counsellors). Is there an "understanding" on the going rate? Does the rate go up with inflation?
