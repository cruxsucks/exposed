## 1. CRUX CONTENT EXTRACTION

### 1.1 Post Text
**Primary Post:**
"Crux readers have been asking for this detail. Exactly how the councillors voted on Niki Gladding's council committee removal. Our previously unpublished video coverage of the actual Niki Gladding vote and Mayor Lewers' statement. Plus - paywall removed - how QLDC lost vital evidence to support the "clean/treated" sewage claims."

**Link Text:**
"Exactly who did what - and how they voted - on the Niki Gladding dismissal"

**Additional Text:**
"Crux readers have been asking in considerable numbers for exactly the role played by existing ..."

**Source:** CRUX.ORG.NZ

### 1.2 Crux Engagement in Comments
**Line 88-95: Crux Response to Dean Rankin**
- Dean Rankin asks if Crux has footage of "Embarrassing Barry Bruce Rant"
- Crux responds: "Dean Rankin We don't - have QLDC refused to release the footage to you?"
- Dean confirms QLDC won't release it
- Crux's question implies QLDC may be withholding public information

**Analysis:**
Crux is labeled as "Author" in the comment thread, indicating direct engagement. The exchange suggests investigative journalism but also positions QLDC as potentially suppressing information.

## 2. NZMC STANDARDS ANALYSIS

### 2.1 Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance

**Post Language Analysis:**

**Potentially Problematic Phrasing:**
1. **"Niki Gladding's council committee removal"** vs **"dismissal"** (in link text)
   - Post uses "removal" (accurate)
   - Link uses "dismissal" (implies termination/firing)
   - Niki Gladding herself (line 105) clarifies she was removed from committees but retained "full council" role
   - "Dismissal" is inflammatory and inaccurate

2. **"QLDC lost vital evidence"**
   - States as fact without qualification
   - No QLDC response provided
   - Fits pattern from Case 2891 of making claims without seeking comment

**Balance Concerns:**
- Post promotes "previously unpublished video coverage" suggesting Crux has exclusive content QLDC didn't release
- No mention of QLDC's perspective on the vote
- Timing during election period creates imbalance (voters see one-sided narrative)

**Relevant Historical Pattern:**
- **Case 2891 (UPHELD):** Failed to give QLDC right of reply on key claims
- **Case 2940 (UPHELD):** Failed to report responses that contradicted narrative

**Assessment:**
- **MODERATE CONCERN** for use of "dismissal" vs "removal"
- **MODERATE CONCERN** for one-sided presentation during election period
- Pattern consistent with previous upheld complaints about balance

---

### 2.2 Principle 4: Comment and Fact

**Post Presentation:**
The post is presented as factual news ("Exactly how the councillors voted") but contains editorial framing:
- "Crux readers have been asking in considerable numbers" - positions Crux as responsive to public demand
- "Previously unpublished video coverage" - suggests QLDC suppression
- "Paywall removed" - Crux as public service provider
- "QLDC lost vital evidence" - editorial characterization

**Relevant Historical Pattern:**
- **Case 2891 (UPHELD):** Mixed opinion with news without clear labeling
- **Case 2895 (NOT UPHELD but WARNING):** "Amount of opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news"
- **Case 2940 (UPHELD):** Speculative opinion presented as factual report

**Assessment:**
- **LOW-MODERATE CONCERN:** Post mixes factual promise (vote details) with editorial framing (lost evidence, unpublished video)
- Facebook posts typically allow more editorial tone than news articles
- However, during election period, presentation as news while containing editorial opinion is problematic

---

### 2.3 Principle 6: Headlines and Captions

**Link Text Analysis:**
"Exactly who did what - and how they voted - on the Niki Gladding dismissal"

**Issues:**
- Use of "dismissal" mischaracterizes the action (removal from committees, not council)
- Creates more dramatic impression than "committee removal"
- Niki Gladding confirms (line 105-106): "councillors' job" and she still has role in "full council"

**Relevant Historical Pattern:**
- **Case 2940 (UPHELD):** Headlines stated speculation as fact
- **Case 3356 (UPHELD):** Inaccurate headline and characterization

**Assessment:**
- **MODERATE-HIGH CONCERN:** "Dismissal" is factually inaccurate
- Headline exaggerates severity of action taken
- 100% success rate of upholding Principle 6 complaints (2 of 2 cases)

---

### 2.4 Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest

**Electoral Context Considerations:**

From ReviewContext.MD: "The Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections are underway"

**Post Timing Analysis:**
- Posted September 8, 2024 (during election campaign)
- Comments indicate election voting decisions being influenced
- Multiple comments reference voting intentions:
  - "I now know who exactly I'll be voting for, and who I won't!!!" (Suzanne Haydon)
  - "Now I know who I won't be voting for" (Ryan Lelievre)
  - Discussion of whether Cody Tucker should "be running again"

**Potential Conflict Issues:**
- Crux is positioned as "only local media platform that holds power to account" (from Case 3356)
- No disclosure of any relationships with candidates
- Niki Gladding herself engages in comments (line 104-106)
- Timing maximizes electoral impact

**Assessment:**
- **LOW CONCERN for formal breach** (no evidence of undisclosed relationships)
- **CONTEXTUAL CONCERN** about media influence during election without balanced coverage
- Principle 10 requires disclosure "where a story is enabled by sponsorship, gift or financial inducement"
- No evidence of such arrangements, but electoral timing is notable

---

### 2.5 Overall NZMC Assessment

**Strongest Potential Breaches:**
1. **Principle 6 (Headlines):** "Dismissal" vs "removal" - factually inaccurate
2. **Principle 1 (Balance):** No QLDC perspective during election period
3. **Principle 4 (Comment/Fact):** Editorial framing in news presentation

**Precedent Relevance:**
- Crux has 60% upheld complaint rate (3 of 5 cases)
- 100% of Principle 6 (Headlines) complaints upheld
- Pattern of inadequate balance with QLDC
- "Serious breakdown in professional relationship" noted (Case 2940)

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Facebook posts allow more informal tone than articles
- Video evidence is legitimate journalism
- Public interest in how councillors voted
- Election period makes transparency more important, not less

**Aggravating Factors:**
- Electoral timing amplifies impact
- Historical pattern of similar issues with Crux
- "Dismissal" language is inflammatory during election
- Comment section shows direct influence on voting intentions

---

## 4. CONTEXTUAL CONSIDERATIONS

### 4.1 Electoral Timing
- Post published September 8, 2024 during active election campaign
- Comments show direct influence on voting intentions
- Multiple references to "who I'll vote for"
- Candidates directly engaged (Cody Tucker, Niki Gladding)

### 4.2 Crux Historical Pattern
From NZMC Complaints Summary:
- 60% upheld complaint rate (3 of 5 cases)
- Pattern of inadequate QLDC balance
- "Serious breakdown in professional relationship" with QLDC
- "Festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism"
- Repeated failures to distinguish fact from opinion
- Repeated headline inaccuracies

### 4.3 Platform Responsibility
**Facebook Post vs. Article Distinction:**
- Media Council scope includes "websites, including audio and video streams"
- Social media extensions of news publications are covered
- Crux labeled as "Author" - official publication account
- Post promotes article content with editorial framing

**Moderation Responsibilities:**
- Crux allowed unverified corruption allegations
- No fact-checking of Lewers/Skyline claim
- No balance for QLDC perspective
- Platform amplified electoral impact

---

## 5. POTENTIAL NZMC COMPLAINT GROUNDS

### 5.1 Primary Grounds

**1. Principle 6: Headlines and Captions - STRONG CASE**
- "Dismissal" vs "removal" is factually inaccurate
- Exaggerates severity of action
- 100% historical success rate on Principle 6 complaints against Crux
- Precedent: Cases 2940 and 3356 both upheld

**2. Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance - MODERATE CASE**
- No QLDC perspective during election period
- "Lost vital evidence" stated as fact without qualification
- Electoral timing amplifies imbalance
- Precedent: Cases 2891, 2940, 3356 all upheld on this principle

**3. Principle 4: Comment and Fact - MODERATE CASE**
- Editorial framing mixed with factual presentation
- "Previously unpublished video" implies suppression (editorial view)
- Presented as news but contains opinion
- Precedent: Cases 2891 and 2940 upheld

### 5.2 Secondary Considerations

**Platform Moderation:**
- While not traditional NZMC ground, the allowance of defamatory comments without fact-checking shows pattern
- Comments section amplifies unbalanced narrative
- Crux engagement reinforces anti-QLDC framing

**Electoral Context:**
- Timing maximizes damage to incumbent councillors
- Direct influence on voting visible in comments
- No balanced coverage of why vote occurred

### 5.3 Evidence Required for Complaint

**For Principle 6 (Headlines):**
- Screenshot of post showing "dismissal" language
- Niki Gladding's comment clarifying she retained "full council" role
- QLDC documentation showing "committee removal" not "dismissal"

**For Principle 1 (Balance):**
- Evidence that QLDC perspective was not sought
- Electoral calendar showing timing
- Comments showing voting influence
- Pattern from previous complaints (Cases 2891, 2940)

**For Principle 4 (Comment/Fact):**
- Post text showing editorial framing
- Comparison to news article standards
- Previous case warnings about "opinion sprinkled through news"

---

## 6. RECOMMENDATIONS

### 6.1 For Potential Complainant

**Strongest Complaint Path:**
1. **Lead with Principle 6:** "Dismissal" is demonstrably inaccurate
2. **Support with Principle 1:** No balance during election period
3. **Reference pattern:** Crux's 60% upheld rate and 100% Principle 6 success rate

**Timing:**
- Must complain to Crux within 1 month of publication (September 8, 2024)
- **DEADLINE PASSED** if current date is after October 8, 2024
- Then to NZMC within 20 working days if unsatisfied

**Complainant Standing:**
- QLDC has strongest standing (subject of post)
- Mayor Lewers (subject of corruption allegation in comments)
- Cody Tucker (subject of multiple attacks in comments)
- Any voter influenced by inaccurate information

### 6.2 For NZMC Consideration

**Aggravating Factors:**
- Historical pattern (60% upheld rate)
- Electoral timing
- Inflammatory language ("dismissal")
- Platform amplification of unverified claims
- No apparent moderation of defamatory comments

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Public interest in councillor votes
- Video evidence is legitimate journalism
- Facebook posts have more informal standards
- Niki Gladding herself engaged (insider validation)

### 6.3 Pattern Analysis

**This post exhibits 4 of 6 Crux repeat patterns:**
1. ✓ Inadequate balance (no QLDC perspective)
2. ✓ Inaccurate headline ("dismissal" vs "removal")
3. ✓ Unprofessional conduct (allowing defamatory comments)
4. ✓ Fact/opinion mixing (editorial framing in news post)
5. ✗ Not applicable: Right of reply (not primary article)
6. ✗ Not applicable: Hostile exchanges (though comment section hostile)

**Historical Trajectory:**
- March 2020: First upheld complaint
- May 2020: Warning to "take greater care"
- September 2020: "Serious breakdown" noted
- December 2022: Council "disappointed by conduct"
- **September 2024: This post** - During election, after multiple upheld complaints

---

## 7. CONCLUSION

This Facebook post demonstrates continued adherence to patterns that have resulted in 60% of NZMC complaints against Crux being upheld. The use of "dismissal" instead of "removal" is the clearest breach (Principle 6), with strong precedent for upholding. The lack of balance during an election period (Principle 1) and mixing of editorial framing with news presentation (Principle 4) provide supporting grounds.

The sentiment analysis reveals the post's significant electoral impact, with 79% of comments containing QLDC corruption references and 38% targeting specific councillors. The platform's failure to moderate unverified allegations (Lewers/Skyline, Tucker/China conflicts, systemic bullying claims) during an election campaign raises questions about responsible journalism standards on social media.

**Overall Assessment:** MODERATE-HIGH likelihood of NZMC complaint success, particularly on Principle 6 (Headlines), supported by Principles 1 (Balance) and 4 (Comment/Fact).
