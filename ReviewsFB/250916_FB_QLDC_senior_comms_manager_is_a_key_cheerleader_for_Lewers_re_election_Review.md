## 2. NZMC STANDARDS ANALYSIS

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** POTENTIAL BREACH - Requires full article review

**Concerns:**
1. **Headline characterization:** "Key cheerleader" is highly charged language that implies impropriety
2. **Partial quote in post:** "acting as a private citizen" - truncated quote may lack context
3. **Balance unclear:** Post doesn't indicate whether Ben Scott or other perspectives were included
4. **Fairness question:** Characterizing employee's private political activities as problematic without full context

**Historical Pattern:** Crux has been upheld 3 times for Principle 1 violations (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356)
- Failed to give right of reply on key claims
- Selective presentation of facts
- Inaccurate characterizations

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** LIKELY BREACH

**Concerns:**
1. **Labeled as "Analysis"** but headline uses highly opinionated language ("cheerleader")
2. **Fact vs Opinion blur:** Presenting staff member's lawful private political activity as scandal
3. **Missing clear opinion labeling:** While marked "Analysis," the headline reads as factual news

**Historical Pattern:** Crux has been upheld 2 times for Principle 4 violations (Cases 2891, 2940)
- "Opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news"
- Media Council warned: "strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future"
- Failed to clearly distinguish factual information from editorial opinion

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** LIKELY BREACH

**Concerns:**
1. **"Key cheerleader"** - inflammatory characterization not likely supported by neutral facts
2. **Implies wrongdoing** where employee may be exercising lawful private political rights
3. **Prejudicial framing** before reader sees full context or QLDC's defense

**Historical Pattern:** Crux has been upheld 2 times for Principle 6 violations (Cases 2940, 3356) - 100% of cases alleging this breach
- Headlines stated speculation as fact
- Headlines misrepresented nature of reported events
- Media Council: Headlines must "accurately and fairly convey the substance"

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** POSSIBLE CONCERN

**Concerns:**
1. **Targeting individual employee** by name for private political activities
2. **Professional discrimination:** Singling out communications manager for political views
3. **Chilling effect:** Story may discourage public sector workers from exercising democratic rights

### Election Context Concerns
**Special Considerations:**
1. **During active election period** - heightened sensitivity
2. **Named individual:** Ben Scott identified personally
3. **Employer defense included:** "acting as a private citizen" suggests QLDC supports employee's right
4. **Public interest question:** Is there genuine wrongdoing or lawful political participation?

## 4. FACEBOOK PLATFORM RESPONSIBILITY

### Crux's Role as Publisher
**Social Media Standards from NZMC History:**
- **Case 2895 (2020):** Media Council warned Crux about "flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers"
- **Requirement:** "Maintain professional standards on social media"
- **Case 2940 (2020):** Noted "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism"

### Content Moderation Concerns
1. **Unsubstantiated criminal allegations:** "Backhanders" (bribery) allowed to stand
2. **Personal attacks:** Doug Harrap's attacks on Ben Scott's character
3. **Inflammatory political content:** During active election period
4. **Lack of moderation:** No visible corrections or context added by Crux

### Publisher Responsibility
Under NZMC precedent:
- Publishers responsible for social media content they control
- Should avoid comments that "provoke readers"
- Professional standards apply to Facebook as to main publication
- Crux has editorial control over what comments remain visible

---

## 5. COMPARISON TO HISTORICAL COMPLAINTS

### Pattern Match: Case 2940 (QAC - Upheld)
**Similarities:**
- Headlines stating speculation as fact
- Speculative opinion presented as factual report
- Inaccurate and unfair characterizations
- **Critical finding:** "Festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism"

**This case:**
- "Key cheerleader" headline is characterization, not fact
- Presents private political activity as scandal
- May reflect continuing antagonism toward QLDC

### Pattern Match: Case 3356 (Andrew Tipene - Upheld)
**Similarities:**
- Targeting individual by name
- Media Council: "Disappointed by Crux's conduct"
- Should have given subject proper opportunity to comment

**This case:**
- Ben Scott named and characterized negatively
- Unclear if Scott given proper right of reply beyond truncated QLDC statement
- Personal reputation implications

### Pattern Match: Case 2895 (Not Upheld - but warned)
**Similarities:**
- Social media conduct
- Media Council: "Strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future"
- "Flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers"

**This case:**
- Provocative headline on Facebook
- Comments section shows provoked readers (corruption allegations, personal attacks)
- Crux failed to moderate inflammatory content

---

## 6. PUBLIC INTEREST ASSESSMENT

### Legitimate Public Interest Elements
1. **Policy consistency:** Cath Gilmour's allegation of double standards is legitimate public interest
2. **Election transparency:** Public has right to know about potential conflicts of interest
3. **Government accountability:** QLDC staff conduct during elections is newsworthy
4. **Legal compliance:** Whether Local Government rules were followed

### Questionable Framing
1. **Private political rights:** Public employees entitled to private political activities
2. **"Cheerleader" framing:** Implies impropriety where lawful activity may exist
3. **QLDC defense omitted:** Post truncates "acting as a private citizen" defense
4. **Individual targeting:** Naming Ben Scott may be disproportionate if activity was lawful

### Balance Test
**Missing elements:**
- Full context of Ben Scott's activities
- Complete QLDC response on legal/policy basis
- Whether activities occurred during work hours or private time
- Comparison to other jurisdictions' policies on public sector political activities
- Whether Scott's position gives him influence over election-related decisions

---

## 7. OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### NZMC Breach Likelihood: HIGH

**Probable Breaches:**
1. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact):** High probability
   - Analysis piece with fact-like headline
   - Opinion presented as news
   - Historical pattern (upheld 2/2 cases)

2. **Principle 6 (Headlines):** High probability
   - "Key cheerleader" is inflammatory characterization
   - May not fairly convey full story substance
   - Historical pattern (upheld 2/2 cases)

3. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance):** Moderate-High probability
   - Fairness to Ben Scott unclear
   - QLDC defense appears truncated
   - Balance may be lacking
   - Historical pattern (upheld 3/5 cases)

### Aggravating Factors
1. **Election timing:** During active election period, heightening sensitivity
2. **Named individual:** Personal reputation damage to Ben Scott
3. **Pattern continuation:** Continues antagonistic relationship with QLDC (5+ complaints)
4. **Social media amplification:** Provocative headline generated inflammatory comments
5. **Historical non-compliance:** Crux has not improved despite 60% upheld complaint rate

### Comment Section Toxicity
- **60.9% hostile/accusatory** comments
- **39.1% allege QLDC institutional corruption**
- **Multiple unsubstantiated criminal allegations** (bribery, fraud)
- **Personal character attacks** on named individual (Ben Scott)
- **Inflammatory political content** during election (may influence voters)

### Media Council Precedent Application
Based on historical cases:
- **Case 2940:** Media Council concerned about "festering mutual suspicion" - this continues pattern
- **Case 3356:** "Disappointed by Crux's conduct" - failure to improve standards
- **Case 2895:** Warned to maintain professional standards on social media - not followed

## 8. RECOMMENDATIONS

### If Preparing Complaint

**Primary Grounds:**
1. **Principle 1:** Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
   - Unfair characterization of Ben Scott's lawful activities
   - Incomplete presentation of QLDC's defense
   - Lack of balance on employee political rights

2. **Principle 4:** Comment and Fact
   - Opinion piece presented with factual headline
   - "Key cheerleader" is editorial opinion, not fact
   - Continues pattern of mixing comment and news

3. **Principle 6:** Headlines and Captions
   - "Key cheerleader" does not fairly convey substance
   - Inflammatory characterization prejudices reader
   - May state opinion as fact

**Supporting Evidence Needed:**
1. Full article text (currently truncated in post)
2. Documentation of Ben Scott's actual activities
3. Complete QLDC statement/policy on staff political activities
4. Evidence of whether Scott was given right of reply
5. Local Government rules on staff election involvement
6. Screenshots of comment section (preservation of evidence)

**Strongest Arguments:**
1. **Cath Gilmour's testimony:** Provides evidence of policy inconsistency/double standards
2. **Historical pattern:** 60% upheld rate shows systematic issues
3. **Election timing:** Heightened duty of care during democratic process
4. **Individual harm:** Named person's reputation damaged
5. **Social media responsibility:** Failed to maintain professional standards

**Potential Weaknesses:**
1. **Public interest defense:** May be legitimate public interest in policy inconsistency
2. **Public figure:** Ben Scott may be considered public figure as senior QLDC comms manager
3. **Incomplete information:** Full article not visible, hard to assess complete balance
4. **Political sensitivity:** Complaint could be seen as protecting QLDC from scrutiny

---

## 9. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Total Comments:** 23 unique commenters (29 total with replies)
- **QLDC Institutional Corruption Allegations:** 39.1% (9/23)
- **Councillor/Mayor Corruption Allegations:** 17.4% (4/23)
- **Combined Corruption Allegations:** 56.5% (13/23)
- **Hostile/Accusatory Sentiment:** 60.9% (14/23)
- **Neutral/Questioning Sentiment:** 21.7% (5/23)
- **Defensive of Subject/Skeptical of Crux:** 8.7% (2/23)
- **Supportive (non-substantive):** 8.7% (2/23)

### Qualitative Assessment
**Dominant Narrative:** QLDC is corrupt, has double standards, and Mayor Lewers has "ruined" Queenstown

**Comment Quality:** Low - many unsubstantiated allegations, personal attacks, inflammatory rhetoric

**Crux's Role:** Headline appears to have successfully provoked hostile reaction, fulfilling Media Council's 2020 warning about "provoking readers"

**Electoral Impact:** Comments actively campaigning against Mayor Lewers during election period, potentially influencing democratic process

**Legal Risk:** Multiple comments contain potentially defamatory allegations (bribery, fraud, corruption) without evidence

---

## 10. CONCLUSION

This Facebook post continues Crux's established pattern of NZMC violations, particularly:
1. Mixing opinion and fact without clear distinction
2. Using inflammatory headlines that don't fairly convey substance
3. Potential lack of fairness to individuals named
4. Failure to maintain professional standards on social media

The post generated highly toxic comment section with majority alleging corruption without evidence, during active election period, targeting named individuals. This fulfills Media Council's 2020 warning about Crux's social media conduct "likely to provoke readers."

**NZMC Breach Assessment:** HIGH probability of upholding complaint on Principles 1, 4, and 6 based on historical pattern and current conduct.

**Sentiment Assessment:** Overwhelmingly hostile (60.9%), with majority (56.5%) making unsubstantiated corruption allegations against public officials during election.
