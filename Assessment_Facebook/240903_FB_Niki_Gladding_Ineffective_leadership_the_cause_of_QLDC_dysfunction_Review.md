## 2. NZMC PRINCIPLES ANALYSIS

### Potential Breaches Identified

#### **Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance - POTENTIAL BREACH**

**Analysis:**
The headline "Ineffective leadership the cause of QLDC dysfunction" presents a subjective opinion as if it were established fact. This is Councillor Gladding's perspective, not an objective assessment.

**Issues:**
- The headline does not indicate this is one councillor's opinion/perspective
- No balance provided from current council leadership or other councillors
- During an election period, this one-sided presentation could be seen as unfair to those characterized as providing "ineffective leadership"
- The post content itself does not identify who this "ineffective leadership" refers to

**Context from Historical Complaints:**
- Case 2940: Crux upheld for headlines stating speculation as fact
- Case 2891: Upheld for failing to give right of reply on key claims
- Case 3356: Upheld for inaccurate headlines and characterizations

**Severity:** MODERATE - While this is clearly an interview format, the headline presentation lacks necessary caveats that this is the candidate's opinion. During election periods, particular care should be taken to ensure balance when making serious allegations about leadership effectiveness.

---

#### **Principle 4: Comment and Fact - POTENTIAL BREACH**

**Analysis:**
The post and headline blur the line between factual reporting and opinion/commentary.

**Issues:**
- "Ineffective leadership" is presented as established fact rather than candidate's opinion
- "The cause of QLDC dysfunction" suggests causation has been proven
- The post format (news announcement) vs. the content (political opinion during election) are not clearly distinguished

**Context from Historical Complaints:**
- Case 2891: Upheld for mixing opinion with news without clear labeling
- Case 2895: Not upheld but Media Council "strongly suggests Crux take greater care" noting "opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news"
- Case 2940: Upheld for speculative opinion presented as factual report

**Severity:** MODERATE - The post presents political opinion/candidate statements in a news format without sufficient labeling or framing to distinguish the opinion from fact.

---

#### **Principle 6: Headlines and Captions - POTENTIAL BREACH**

**Analysis:**
The headline does not accurately convey that this is a candidate's opinion/allegation rather than an established fact.

**Issues:**
- More accurate would be: "Niki Gladding claims ineffective leadership causes QLDC dysfunction" or "Candidate Gladding: Ineffective leadership to blame for council issues"
- Current headline could mislead readers into believing leadership ineffectiveness has been independently verified

**Context from Historical Complaints:**
- Case 2940: Upheld under Principle 6 for headlines stating speculation as fact
- Case 3356: Upheld under Principle 6 for inaccurate headlines
- Media Council: "Headlines must accurately reflect story content" and "Cannot state unproven claims as fact in headlines"

**Severity:** MODERATE - The headline presents subjective opinion as objective fact.

---

### Election Period Considerations

**Special Context:**
This post was published during the local government election period when:
- Candidates are seeking election/re-election
- Public opinion is being actively formed
- Balance and fairness have heightened importance
- Claims about "ineffective leadership" directly impact electoral choices

**Media Council Guidance:**
While the Council recognizes advocacy journalism and forthright stances, it maintains that "standards of ethical journalism must still be maintained" and facts/opinions must be clearly distinguished.

---

### COMMENT MODERATION CONCERNS

**Publisher Responsibility:**
Under NZMC principles and Crux's historical complaints, the publisher has responsibility for content on their platforms, including social media.

**Specific Concerns:**

1. **Sandi Mulholland's comment:**
   - Contains direct personal attack on named councillor
   - Allegations of bullying behavior
   - Conspiracy theory language ("cronies," "hidden agendas")
   - Potentially defamatory
   - **Question:** Should Crux be moderating direct personal attacks on named individuals?

2. **Edward Coad's comment:**
   - Crude language ("Shitover River")
   - Broad allegations of incompetence and hidden agendas
   - Less severe than Mulholland but still inflammatory

**Historical Context:**
- Case 2895: Media Council warned Crux about "flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers" and told them to "maintain professional standards on social media"
- Council emphasized need for care on social media platforms

**Moderation Standard:**
Given Crux's history of Media Council findings regarding social media conduct, the lack of moderation of directly defamatory comments naming specific councillors ("bully Lewers and his cronies") may represent failure to maintain professional standards on social media.

---

## 4. OVERALL ASSESSMENT

### NZMC Compliance Summary

**Principles at Risk:**
1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance)** - MODERATE BREACH
2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact)** - MODERATE BREACH
3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions)** - MODERATE BREACH

**Aggravating Factors:**
- Election period context (heightened duty of care)
- Crux's history of upheld complaints on these exact issues
- Serious allegations ("ineffective leadership") without attribution or balance
- Pattern consistent with previous upheld complaints (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356)

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Interview format is inherently opinionated
- Public interest in election candidates' views
- Candidate's right to express criticism of council
- Post does indicate this is part of interview series

---

### Social Media Moderation Assessment

**Status:** CONCERNING

The comment section contains:
- Direct personal attacks on named councillor
- Potentially defamatory statements
- Inflammatory conspiracy theories
- Crude/disrespectful language

Given Media Council's previous warnings to Crux about social media conduct (Case 2895), the presence of unmoderated defamatory comments represents potential breach of professional standards.

---

## 5. RECOMMENDATIONS

### For NZMC Complaint (if pursued):

**Primary Grounds:**
1. **Principle 1:** Headline and post lack balance during election period; serious allegation of "ineffective leadership" without attribution or opportunity for response
2. **Principle 4:** Opinion presented as fact; insufficient distinction between candidate's political claims and factual reporting
3. **Principle 6:** Headline states opinion as fact without proper attribution

**Supporting Arguments:**
- Pattern of similar breaches in Cases 2891, 2940, 3356
- Election period requires heightened care
- Historical pattern shows Crux has not heeded Media Council guidance
- Social media moderation failures compound the issues

**Strength of Complaint:** MODERATE
- Clear issues with headline presentation
- Election context strengthens fairness arguments
- Historical pattern supports claim of ongoing failure to distinguish fact from opinion
- However, interview format provides some defense

---

### For Publisher (Crux):

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Consider moderating or removing defamatory comment by Sandi Mulholland
2. Review social media moderation policies given Media Council's previous warnings

**Future Actions:**
1. Use attribution in headlines during election periods: "Candidate claims..." vs. stating as fact
2. Ensure opinion/commentary is clearly labeled
3. Consider balance when making serious allegations about leadership effectiveness
4. Implement clearer social media moderation standards for personal attacks

---

## 6. CONCLUSION

This Facebook post demonstrates continuing patterns identified in Crux's upheld NZMC complaints, particularly:
- Presenting opinion as fact (Principles 1, 4)
- Inaccurate/misleading headlines (Principle 6)
- Inadequate distinction between comment and factual reporting (Principle 4)

The election period context and the specific allegation of "ineffective leadership" presented without attribution or balance heightens the concern.

The unmoderated inflammatory comments, particularly the direct personal attack naming a councillor as a "bully" with "cronies," raises additional concerns about Crux's social media standards given previous Media Council warnings.

**Compliance Rating:** POOR
**Complaint Viability:** MODERATE
**Pattern Consistency:** HIGH (consistent with previous upheld complaints)
