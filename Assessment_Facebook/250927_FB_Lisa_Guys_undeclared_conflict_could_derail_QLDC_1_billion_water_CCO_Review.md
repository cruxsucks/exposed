## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance

**Assessment: POTENTIAL BREACH**

**Concerns:**

1. **Statement of Fact vs. Attribution:**
   - Post states definitively: "The Auditor-General says she should not have voted"
   - This is presented as established fact rather than as opinion or interpretation
   - Need to verify: Did Auditor-General make this exact statement or is Crux interpreting findings?

2. **Missing Context:**
   - No indication of Lisa Guy's response or defense in the Facebook post
   - No mention of whether she sought legal/procedural advice before voting
   - Post does not indicate if the full article provides Guy's perspective

3. **Balance Issues:**
   - Facebook post heavily weighted toward negative interpretation
   - No mention of any possible legitimate reasons for the vote
   - "Against 75% of public submissions" - while potentially accurate, needs context about how council votes relate to submissions

**Historical Pattern:**
- Case 2891 (UPHELD): Failed to give QLDC right of reply on key claims
- Case 2940 (UPHELD): Failed to report QAC's response that contradicted narrative
- Case 3356 (UPHELD): Should have given subject opportunity to comment before publication

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact

**Assessment: POTENTIAL BREACH**

**Concerns:**

1. **Speculative Question as News:**
   - Post asks: "So does the vote now have to be taken again?"
   - This is speculative/rhetorical question presented within factual news post
   - Mixes factual claims (what happened) with opinion/speculation (what should happen)

2. **Implication vs. Statement:**
   - Post structure implies wrongdoing without clear separation of fact from editorial judgment
   - "Could derail" is speculation presented in headline-style format

3. **Facebook as News Medium:**
   - Social media post blurs fact/opinion more than formal article
   - No clear labeling as "opinion" or "analysis"

**Historical Pattern:**
- Case 2891 (UPHELD): Mixed opinion with news without clear labeling
- Case 2895 (NOT UPHELD but warned): "Opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news"
- Case 2940 (UPHELD): Speculative opinion presented as factual report

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions

**Assessment: REQUIRES VERIFICATION**

**Concerns:**

1. **"Could derail" Language:**
   - Headline uses speculative language ("could derail")
   - Implies uncertainty but presents as dramatic possibility
   - Needs verification: Is there actual legal risk of vote being invalidated?

2. **"$1 billion" Figure:**
   - Dramatic financial figure in headline
   - Needs verification: Is this accurate valuation of water services?
   - Historical breach: Case 2940 upheld for inaccurate dollar amounts in headlines

3. **"Undeclared conflict":**
   - States as fact that conflict was "undeclared"
   - Needs verification: Did Lisa Guy actively fail to declare, or did she believe declaration wasn't required?

**Historical Pattern:**
- Case 2940 (UPHELD): Headlines stated speculation as fact
- Case 3356 (UPHELD): Inaccurate headline and characterization

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest (Meta-Analysis)

**Assessment: RELEVANT TO CRUX'S OWN CONDUCT**

**Observation:**
- Crux identifies Stephen Brent as "2025 QLDC candidate" and "lawyer acting as trustee to Lisa Guy's Rationale shares"
- This creates web of connections between candidates during election period
- Question: Does Crux have any conflicts of interest in election coverage?
- Are they supporting or opposing specific candidates?
- Financial relationships with any candidates or campaigns?

**Electoral Context:**
- Published during active election period (September 27, 2024)
- Content directly impacts electoral prospects of sitting councillor
- Timing raises questions about electoral influence vs. public interest journalism

**Most Inflammatory:**

1. **Craig Perkins:** "Absolute gluttonous trough feeder she is definitely past her use by date" (dehumanizing imagery)

2. **Jan Johnson:** "Disgusting, scheming humans. How much more corrupt can it get the list is so long its hard to keep up, shameful! Last Mayor was interesting enough must be 'in the water' this unforgiving behaviour. Surely this all belongs in the hands of the courts."

3. **Gab Ruiz:** "Corruption all over, & probably just the tip of the iceberg, corruption is a cancer that if you don't cut it from the roots and everything that touched, it will just keep spreading and rotting the system. Great work from the investigators and the team who is behind this article, they are brave enough to go deep into the sewer of the Corrupted Council"

4. **Stewart Green:** "Just vote her out - simple. She and her family have taken the Council for a ride awarding contracts when there was a clear conflict of intrests.

5. **Sandi Mulholland:** "easily fooled much?" (dismissive attack on Christina Dawson)

6. **Chris Dark:** "clown world" (dismissive mockery)

### Christina Dawson Thread Analysis

**Significance:** Extended exchange between Christina Dawson and Crux represents rare counter-narrative in comments.

**Dawson's Position:**
- Met with Lisa Guy personally
- Decided to continue support despite concerns
- Believes Crux may have "hidden agenda" or "confirmation bias"
- Accuses journalist of making "thigh bones out of tidbits of scraps"
- Acknowledges not taking everything on trust but willing to give second chance

**Crux's Response:**
- Requests specific factual errors or wrong assumptions
- Defensive about agenda: "We have no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness"
- References QLDC's low trust rating (17% or "more accurately 4%")
- Repeatedly asks Dawson to identify specific problems with article
- Multiple follow-up comments pressing for specifics

**Community Response to Dawson:**
- Ian Moore: "people like you who refuse to provide any substance when asked questions"
- Sandi Mulholland: "easily fooled much?"
- Cheryl Kubala: "and you believe what she says?? Wow!"
- Bernice Hassed: Support for doing due diligence
- Mary Teresa: Defense of Crux's investigative role

**Analysis:**
This exchange demonstrates:
1. Crux actively engages in comment threads, defending reporting
2. Community polarized between anti-council and questioning-media camps
3. Dawson unable/unwilling to provide specific factual errors when challenged
4. Crux uses comment section for editorial defense and narrative reinforcement

## Legal Threats Notice Analysis

**Crux Statement:** "Please note - some comments have been hidden following legal threats from Lisa Guy."

**NZMC Implications:**

1. **Transparency Concern:**
   - Readers cannot see what was hidden
   - No indication of how many comments removed
   - No clarity on whether removed comments were defamatory or truthful

2. **Platform Moderation:**
   - Crux controls which comments remain visible
   - Could selectively remove comments favorable to Guy
   - Or could legitimately remove defamatory content

3. **Legal Threat Context:**
   - Publicizing "legal threats" frames Guy as attempting to suppress speech
   - Creates narrative that Guy is attacking free press
   - But could also indicate Crux published defamatory content

4. **Historical Pattern:**
   - Case 2940: Media Council noted "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism marked by stonewalling and hostile email exchanges"
   - This notice suggests ongoing adversarial relationship

---

## Electoral Context Considerations

**Timing:**
- Published September 27, 2024 during active election period
- Lisa Guy is standing for re-election in Arrowtown ward
- Stephen Brent identified as "2025 QLDC candidate" and Guy's trustee
- Election appears imminent

**Electoral Impact:**
- Post directly impacts Guy's electoral prospects
- 71.7% negative sentiment in comments
- Calls for Guy to withdraw from race
- Creates association between Guy and broader "corruption" narrative

**Public Interest vs. Electoral Interference:**
- Legitimate public interest in conflict of interest allegations
- But timing and framing raise questions about electoral motivation
- Crux's historical antagonism with QLDC documented in Media Council cases
- Question: Is this accountability journalism or electoral campaigning?

---

## Comparison to Historical NZMC Breaches

### Pattern Matching: Case 3356 (UPHELD - December 2022)

**Similar Elements:**
1. Individual (Andrew Tipene) accused of financial conflict
2. Published without adequate right of reply

4. Media Council "disappointed by Crux's conduct"

**Current Post Similarities:**
- Individual (Lisa Guy) accused of financial conflict
- Unknown if adequate right of reply given (not evident in Facebook post)
- Headline uses dramatic framing ("could derail $1 billion")
- Legal threats mentioned, suggesting adversarial relationship

### Pattern Matching: Case 2940 (UPHELD - September 2020)

**Similar Elements:**
1. Financial claims in headlines (QAC "$200m land purchase")
2. Speculation presented as news
3. Failed to report subject's contradicting response
4. Hostile relationship with subject

**Current Post Similarities:**
- Financial claim in headline ("$1 billion water CCO")
- Speculative question ("does the vote now have to be taken again?")
- No indication of Guy's response in Facebook post
- Legal threats suggest hostile relationship

### Pattern Matching: Case 2891 (UPHELD - March 2020)

**Similar Elements:**
1. QLDC-related controversy
2. Failed to give right of reply on key claims
3. Mixed opinion with news
4. Lack of balance

**Current Post Similarities:**
- QLDC councillor controversy
- No evident right of reply in post
- Mixes factual claims with speculative questions
- Heavily weighted toward negative interpretation

## Facebook Comment Moderation Analysis

**Crux's Role as Publisher:**

Under NZMC principles, Crux bears responsibility for:
1. Content they publish (the post itself)
2. Comments they allow to remain visible
3. Comments they choose to hide or remove

**Potential Issues:**

1. **Defamatory Comments Allowed:**
   - Multiple comments allege "corruption" without evidence
   - Personal attacks ("gluttonous trough feeder")
   - Criminal implications ("belongs in the hands of the courts")
   - Crux has not moderated these comments

2. **Selective Moderation:**
   - Hidden comments per "legal threats from Lisa Guy"
   - But inflammatory anti-Guy comments remain
   - Suggests possible selective enforcement favoring negative narrative

3. **Platform Amplification:**
   - Crux actively participates in comments
   - Defends article and requests criticisms
   - Reinforces negative narrative through engagement
   - Uses comment section to continue adversarial stance

**Historical Context:**
- Case 2895: Media Council warned about "flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers"
- Council advised: "Maintain professional standards on social media"

---

## Key Questions for NZMC Complaint

If pursuing formal complaint, these questions require answers:

1. **Accuracy:**
   - Did the Auditor-General specifically state Guy "should not have voted" or is this Crux's interpretation?
   - Is the "$1 billion" valuation accurate?
   - Was the vote truly "against 75% of public submissions" and if so, is this standard way to characterize council voting?

2. **Fairness:**
   - Was Lisa Guy given opportunity to respond before publication?
   - Does the linked article include her perspective?
   - Were her reasons for voting included?

3. **Balance:**
   - Was any exculpatory information available but not included?
   - Did Guy seek procedural advice before voting?
   - Are there legitimate reasons the vote might not need to be retaken?

4. **Fact vs. Opinion:**
   - Is "could derail" speculation or based on legal analysis?
   - Is the question "does the vote now have to be taken again?" rhetorical opinion or genuine uncertainty?

5. **Comments Moderation:**
   - Which comments were hidden and why?
   - Why were inflammatory/potentially defamatory comments allowed to remain?
   - Does Crux's participation in comments constitute editorial endorsement?

6. **Electoral Context:**
   - Does Crux have position on election outcomes?
   - Any financial or personal relationships with opposing candidates?
   - Is timing coincidental or strategic?

---

## Recommendations

### For Potential Complainant (Lisa Guy):

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Document all hidden comments (if accessible)
   - Screenshot current visible comments showing inflammatory content
   - Gather evidence of actual Auditor-General statements for accuracy comparison
   - Document timeline of right-of-reply opportunities (if any)

2. **NZMC Complaint Focus:**
   - **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance):** Primary ground
     - Verify factual claims about Auditor-General statement
     - Document lack of right of reply
     - Show missing exculpatory context

   - **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact):** Secondary ground
     - Speculation presented as news ("could derail," "does vote have to be taken again")

   - **Principle 6 (Headlines):** Potential ground
     - If "$1 billion" or "could derail" inaccurate/misleading

3. **Comment Moderation Issue:**
   - Could argue Crux has responsibility for defamatory comments left visible
   - Selective moderation suggests bias
   - Platform participation amplifies unfair narrative

4. **Electoral Context:**
   - Timing during election period relevant to impact assessment
   - Public interest defense weakened if primarily electoral interference

### For NZMC Analysis:

1. **Historical Pattern Recognition:**
   - This post exhibits patterns from 3 upheld complaints
   - 60% upheld rate against Crux (2020-2022)
   - Consistent issues: fact/opinion, right of reply, headlines, hostile relationships

2. **Social Media Standards:**
   - Apply same standards to Facebook posts as articles
   - Publisher responsibility extends to comment moderation
   - Active participation in comments = editorial involvement

3. **Electoral Journalism Standards:**
   - Higher scrutiny during election periods
   - Balance especially important for candidate coverage
   - Public interest must genuinely outweigh electoral interference

## Conclusion

This Facebook post demonstrates patterns consistent with Crux's historical NZMC breaches, particularly regarding:
- Potential mixing of fact and opinion
- Possible lack of adequate right of reply (needs verification)
- Speculative framing presented within news format
- Inflammatory comment section with selective moderation

The 71.7% negative sentiment and 41.3% corruption-allegation rate in comments, combined with Crux's active participation defending the story, suggests the post created a heavily weighted negative narrative during an election period.

The rare counter-narrative from Christina Dawson, when challenged by Crux to provide specific errors, could not identify factual problems—but this does not necessarily validate the post's fairness or balance if key context or right of reply were missing.

Given Crux's 60% upheld complaint rate and documented patterns of similar breaches, this post warrants careful NZMC scrutiny, particularly regarding:
1. Accuracy of Auditor-General claim
2. Whether Lisa Guy had adequate opportunity to respond
3. Whether speculative elements are clearly distinguished from facts
4. Whether comment moderation was fair and balanced

**Potential NZMC Breach Strength:**
- **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance):** MODERATE-HIGH (pending verification)
- **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact):** MODERATE
- **Principle 6 (Headlines):** MODERATE (pending verification)

**Review Completed:** 2025-10-03
