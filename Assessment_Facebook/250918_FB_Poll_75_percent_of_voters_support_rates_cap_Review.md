## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Facebook post by Crux promotes an article about a rates cap poll during the Queenstown Lakes District Council election period. The post employs inflammatory framing and selectively quotes Mayor Lewers to cast him in a negative light. Combined with permissive comment moderation allowing multiple accusations of corruption and personal attacks, the post demonstrates potential breaches of NZMC Principles 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance), 4 (Comment and Fact), and 6 (Headlines and Captions).

**Key Sentiment Metrics:**
- **Total Comments:** 10
- **QLDC Corruption Claims:** 30% (3 of 10 comments)
- **Councillor Corruption/Misconduct:** 50% (5 of 10 comments)
- **Personal Attacks on Mayor:** 40% (4 of 10 comments)
- **Inflammatory Content:** 60% (6 of 10 comments)

## EXTRACTED CRUX CONTENT

### Post Text
> "Will local councils have to cut their costs to match what ratepayers can afford? Mayor Lewers has called this the "dumbest idea ever.""

### Post Structure
- **Main text:** Inflammatory framing question + selective quote from Mayor Lewers
- **Link preview:** "Poll: 75% of voters support a rates cap"
- **Snippet:** "An overwhelming majority of New Zealanders support the government putting a cap on the a..."
- **Source attribution:** CRUX.ORG.NZ

### Editorial Framing Elements
1. Leading question: "Will local councils have to cut their costs to match what ratepayers can afford?"
2. Selective quotation: Highlighting only Mayor's negative characterization without context
3. Juxtaposition: Positioning Mayor's view against "75% of voters" (majority opinion)
4. Emotive language: "dumbest idea ever" prominently featured

---

## NZMC STANDARDS ANALYSIS

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Status:** POTENTIAL BREACH

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Lack of Balance in Post Framing**
   - Post presents only one side: the Mayor's opposition to rates cap
   - No context provided for Mayor's reasoning or alternative viewpoints
   - Framing question assumes councils don't currently live within budgets
   - Creates false dichotomy: rates cap vs. unlimited spending

2. **Selective Quotation**
   - Highlighting "dumbest idea ever" without context is designed to provoke negative reaction
   - No explanation of why Mayor holds this view
   - Quote presented in isolation to maximize inflammatory impact

3. **Missing Context**
   - No indication of Mayor's full statement or reasoning
   - No acknowledgment of complexities in council financing
   - No mention of statutory obligations councils must meet

**NZMC Precedent from Case 2891:**
> "Failed to give QLDC right of reply on key claims... Lack of balance - only sought documents, didn't ask questions"

**Assessment:** The post frames a complex policy issue in a deliberately one-sided manner designed to generate outrage against the Mayor during an election period.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Status:** POTENTIAL BREACH

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Opinion Framed as Factual Premise**
   - Question "Will local councils have to cut their costs to match what ratepayers can afford?" contains embedded opinion
   - Implies councils currently don't live within budgets (unproven assertion)
   - Presents editorial viewpoint as neutral inquiry

2. **No Clear Labeling**
   - Post not identified as opinion/editorial content
   - Appears as straight news despite containing significant editorial framing
   - Leading question technique disguises opinion as objective reporting

**NZMC Precedent from Case 2895:**
> "Article mixed comment and fact, blurred the line... 'opinion liberally sprinkled through a story presented as news'"

**NZMC Precedent from Case 2940:**
> "Speculative opinion presented as factual report"

**Assessment:** The post mixes opinion with fact presentation without clear distinction, consistent with Crux's established pattern.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Status:** POTENTIAL BREACH

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Inflammatory Framing**
   - Post text functions as headline for linked article
   - Selective quote "dumbest idea ever" designed for maximum negative impact
   - Framing emphasizes conflict over substance

2. **Lack of Fair Representation**
   - Post doesn't fairly convey the substance of debate
   - Focuses on inflammatory quote rather than policy substance
   - Creates misleading impression of Mayor's position

**NZMC Precedent from Case 2940:**
> "Headlines stated speculation as fact... Inaccurate and unfair captions"

**NZMC Precedent from Case 3356:**
> "Inaccurate headline and characterization"

**Assessment:** Post framing serves as headline and fails to accurately/fairly convey substance of the issue.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Status:** REQUIRES INVESTIGATION

**Context Considerations:**
- Posted during QLDC election period (electoral context)
- Pattern of antagonistic coverage toward QLDC/Mayor established in previous NZMC cases
- Media Council noted "serious breakdown in professional relationship" (Case 2940)
- Media Council noted "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" (Case 2940)

**Questions:**
1. Does Crux have relationships with candidates opposing Mayor Lewers?
2. Is there financial or ideological motivation for anti-QLDC content?
3. Should electoral timing be disclosed as context?

## SPECIFIC BREACH EVIDENCE

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance

**Evidence of Breach:**

1. **No Fair Voice to Opposition View**
   - NZMC Principle 1: "In articles of controversy or disagreement, a fair voice must be given to the opposition view"
   - Post presents only negative characterization of Mayor's position
   - No explanation of Mayor's reasoning provided
   - No balance to "75% support" claim

2. **Misleading by Omission**
   - NZMC Principle 1: "should not deliberately mislead or misinform readers by commission or omission"

   - Omits complexities of council funding obligations
   - Omits any counter-arguments to rates cap

**Crux's Defense Pattern (from historical cases):**
- Likely to claim: "advocacy journalism," "consistently opinionated in favour of community"
- **Media Council's Response:** "standards of ethical journalism must still be maintained" even in advocacy journalism

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact

**Evidence of Breach:**

1. **Opinion Not Clearly Presented as Such**
   - NZMC Principle 4: "An article that is essentially comment or opinion should be clearly presented as such"
   - Leading question contains editorial opinion but presented as neutral inquiry
   - No labeling as opinion/editorial content

2. **Comment Mixed with Fact Presentation**
   - NZMC Principle 4: "A clear distinction should be drawn between factual information and comment or opinion"
   - Poll results (fact) mixed with inflammatory framing (opinion)
   - Editorial viewpoint embedded in presentation structure

**Relevant Precedent:** Case 2895 (2020)
> "Council considered upholding due to 'amount of opinion liberally sprinkled through a story presented as news'"

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions

**Evidence of Breach:**

1. **Unfair Representation**
   - NZMC Principle 6: "Headlines, sub-headings, and captions should accurately and fairly convey the substance or a key element of the report"

   - Selective quote chosen for inflammatory impact, not fair representation
   - Focus on "dumbest idea ever" rather than policy debate substance

**Relevant Precedent:** Case 2940 (2020)
> "Headlines stated speculation as fact... Inaccurate and unfair captions"

---

## COMMENT MODERATION AS EDITORIAL DECISION

### Publisher Responsibility for User Comments

**NZMC Principle Application:**
- Publications retain editorial control over published content, including comments
- Decision to allow/remove comments is editorial judgment

   - "promised your mates something" (Jono Green)
   - "trying to hide a sewage problem... trying to silence Nikki" (Kenneth Russell)
   - "french consulting companies... incompetents" (Edward Coad)

2. **Personal Character Attacks:**
   - "privilege... unrelateable" (Susan Manson)
   - "he and his minions" (Tony Maxwell)
   - "dumb ideas" (Kenneth Russell)

**Editorial Pattern:** Crux allowed escalating inflammatory content without:
- Fact-checking claims
- Providing right of reply
- Moderating defamatory allegations
- Adding context or corrections

**Assessment:** Comment moderation choices amplify the post's unbalanced framing.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

### For Potential NZMC Complaint

**Strongest Grounds:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance)**
   - Post provides no fair voice to Mayor's position
   - Selectively quotes to maximize negative impact
   - Omits all context and counter-arguments
   - Allowed unsubstantiated corruption allegations during election

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact)**
   - Editorial opinion embedded in presentation without clear labeling
   - Leading question presents opinion as neutral inquiry
   - Pattern consistent with previous upheld complaints

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions)**
   - Post framing unfairly represents the substance of debate
   - Emphasizes inflammatory quote over policy substance
   - Designed for provocation rather than information

**Supporting Evidence:**
- 60% of complaints against Crux upheld by NZMC (2020-2022)
- Established pattern of fact/opinion mixing (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940)
- Previous warning about social media conduct (Case 2895)
- "Serious breakdown in professional relationship" noted (Case 2940)
- Electoral timing amplifies unfairness

### Additional Considerations

1. **Request Full Article Review**
   - Facebook post links to full article - review needed
   - May contain additional breaches
   - Could strengthen complaint with fuller evidence

2. **Pattern of Electoral Coverage**
   - Review other election-period posts
   - Identify systematic bias
   - Demonstrate pattern beyond single post

3. **Right of Reply Issues**
   - Determine if Mayor given opportunity to respond
   - Check if article contacted Mayor for comment
   - Previous NZMC cases show Crux pattern of inadequate right of reply

## CONCLUSION

This Facebook post demonstrates multiple potential breaches of NZMC principles, consistent with Crux's established pattern from previous upheld complaints. The post combines unbalanced framing, opinion disguised as neutral inquiry, and inflammatory presentation, while allowing serious unsubstantiated allegations during an election period.

**Key Findings:**

1. **NZMC Standards:** Potential breaches of Principles 1, 4, and 6
2. **Historical Pattern:** Consistent with 60% upheld complaint rate (2020-2022)
3. **Electoral Context:** Timing amplifies unfairness and potential impact
4. **Comment Moderation:** Editorial decision to platform corruption allegations without evidence
5. **Sentiment:** 60% strongly negative, 50% containing corruption claims, 0% supportive of Mayor

**Recommendation:** Strong grounds exist for NZMC complaint based on:
- Lack of balance (Principle 1)
- Failure to distinguish fact from opinion (Principle 4)
- Unfair post framing (Principle 6)
- Pattern consistent with previous upheld complaints
- Electoral context requiring higher standards of fairness

---

**Review Completed:** October 3, 2025
**Next Steps:** Review linked article for additional breaches; consider pattern analysis of election-period coverage; prepare formal complaint if warranted.
