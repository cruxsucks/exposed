- **Implication:** Pre-judging outcome as scandalous

## 2. NZMC STANDARDS ANALYSIS

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**POTENTIAL BREACH - Platform Moderation Failure**

**Issue:** Unmoderated Platform for Unsubstantiated Corruption Allegations

**Evidence:**
1. **Direct Corruption Accusations (Line 151-152):**
   - Cal Smith: "Mary Teresa corruption" (in response to comment about Lewers, Guy, and Cocks)
   - **Context:** Direct one-word label without evidence or qualification

2. **Pattern Allegation (Line 154-157):**
   - Cal Smith: "Mary Teresa look at the voting record of these 3 on Queenstown Lakes Community Action and the pattern is there for all to see"
   - **Implication:** Suggests coordinated corrupt behavior pattern

3. **Systemic Corruption Claims (Line 185-188):**
   - Ryann Lourenco: "There's a lot of corruption inside our district and government"
   - **Scope:** Extends corruption allegations beyond specific individuals to entire system

4. **Characterization as Dishonest (Line 43-45):**
   - Cal Smith: "These idiots want us to reelect them. They've promised 'transparency', 'a better relationship with us' Sewers has shown us all that not one of them speaks the truth, they are all in his pocket allowing him/not stopping him from doing this."
   - **Language:** "not one of them speaks the truth," "all in his pocket"

**Media Council Precedent:**
- **Case 2895 (2020):** Council warned that "flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers" and to "maintain professional standards on social media"
- **Case 2940 (2020):** Council noted "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" as problematic pattern

**Analysis:**
- Crux provided platform for serious criminal allegations ("corruption") without:
  - Evidence or substantiation
  - Editorial qualification or context
  - Moderation or challenge
  - Right of reply for accused parties
- During election period, unmoderated corruption allegations could influence voting
- Single Crux comment (line 102) used language "tragedy and the scandal" reinforcing narrative

**Balance Consideration:**
While Crux labeled the article as "Opinion/Candidate Commentary," this does not absolve responsibility for:
- Unmoderated comment sections containing defamatory content
- Failure to distinguish between legitimate policy criticism and corruption allegations
- Platform amplification of inflammatory election-period rhetoric

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**POTENTIAL BREACH - Insufficient Distinction**

**Issue:** Crux's Own Comment Blurs Editorial and Factual Reporting

**Evidence (Line 102-104):**
Crux comment: "we'll be taking a very close look at this - the tragedy and the scandal of this is that QLDC will make us wait 20 days - until after the election"

**Analysis:**
- Uses emotive language: "tragedy and the scandal"
- Pre-judges outcome as scandalous before investigation
- Presented as factual statement ("the scandal") rather than potential issue to investigate
- No qualification such as "alleged concerns" or "questions about"

**Media Council Standard:**
- **Case 2891 (2020):** Upheld for mixing opinion with news without clear labeling
- **Case 2895 (2020):** Council "strongly suggests Crux take greater care" about opinion "liberally sprinkled through a story presented as news"

**Context:**
- Post labeled article as "opinion/commentary" - positive
- But Crux's own comment adopted advocacy tone without clear editorial labeling
- As publisher comment on own platform, higher standard of factual precision expected

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**NO BREACH**

**Analysis:**
- Post accurately summarized article content
- Clearly identified as "opinion/commentary piece"
- Identified author (councillor Niki Gladding)
- Posed question rather than stated conclusion: "But is this best practice? She thinks not."

**Compliance:**
- Meets Principle 6 requirement to "accurately and fairly convey the substance"
- Appropriate labeling helps readers understand nature of content

### Social Media Moderation Standards

**Historical Context:**
- **Case 2895 (2020):** Media Council warned Crux specifically about social media conduct
  - "Flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers"
  - "Exercise caution on social media and maintain professional standards"
  - "Maintain professional standards on social media platforms"

**Current Post Analysis:**
The comment section contains:

**Corruption Allegations (6 comments, 12.2%):**
1. Cal Smith: "corruption" (direct label)
2. Cal Smith: "pattern is there for all to see" (coordinated corruption implication)
3. Ryann Lourenco: "lot of corruption inside our district and government"
4. Cal Smith: "not one of them speaks the truth, they are all in his pocket"
5. Mary Teresa: "Lewers, Guy and Cocks. This has a certain ring to it" (suggesting impropriety)
6. Dave Thompson: "disgusting" (in same thread)

**Inflammatory Language (11 comments, 22.4%):**
- "These idiots" (Cal Smith)
- "corruption" (Cal Smith)
- "slippery slope of bullshite" (Tracey Morrow)
- "disgusting" (Dave Thompson)
- "This is deceitful" (Kathy Voss)
- Multiple demands for removal from office

**Election Period Context:**
- Post published during active election campaign (less than month before election)
- Multiple comments explicitly about voting decisions influenced by these allegations
- Timing amplifies potential harm to candidates' reputations

**Publisher Responsibility:**
- Crux has editorial control over its Facebook comment sections
- Can moderate, remove, or respond to problematic comments
- Previous Media Council warning specifically addressed Facebook conduct
- No evidence of moderation or editorial response to corruption allegations

### Election Period Context

**Timing:** September 19, 2024
**Election Proximity:** "less than month away" (per comment line 36)
**Electoral Impact Evidence:**
- 14 comments (28.6%) explicitly about voting decisions
- Multiple endorsements of specific candidates (John Glover, Nik Kiddle)
- Direct calls not to re-elect current councillors
- Information framed as "who not to vote for"

**Heightened Concern:**
During active election campaigns, unsubstantiated corruption allegations have:
- Greater potential to influence voter decisions
- Limited time for subjects to respond or correct
- Amplified reputational harm
- Democratic process integrity implications

**Most Active Commenters:**

- Crux made single comment committing to investigation
- No Crux moderation of inflammatory/defamatory content visible
- Thread conversations developing complex legal discussions

**Amplification:**
- Crux comment (line 102) reinforced negative narrative with "tragedy and the scandal"
- No editorial intervention to distinguish legitimate criticism from defamation
- Platform provided for election-period attacks without factual basis

## 4. COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH NZMC PRECEDENTS

### Case 2895 (May 2020) - Social Media Standards Warning

**Media Council Finding:**
"The Council strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future to ensure that it does not mix comment and fact, and that it exercises caution on social media and maintains professional standards when interacting with its readers on Facebook."

**Specific Concern:**
"The comment ['will they be having a picnic?'] was also likely to provoke readers."

**Current Post Parallel:**
- Crux comment (line 102): "the tragedy and the scandal" - provocative language
- Comment section contains far more inflammatory content than 2020 case
- No evidence of "greater care" or "caution on social media"
- Professional standards not maintained in comment moderation

**Escalation:**
- 2020: Single flippant comment by Crux
- 2024: Crux comment plus 11 inflammatory user comments including corruption allegations
- 2020: Warning to exercise caution
- 2024: Pattern suggests warning not heeded

### Case 2940 (September 2020) - Professional Relationship Breakdown

**Media Council Finding:**
"The Council is concerned by the serious breakdown in what should be a professional relationship... The email exchanges between Peter Newport and QAC, characterised by Mr Newport as robust, seem to have been marked by a festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism, with both parties contributing to that. The Council believes QAC's stonewalling and Peter Newport's hostile emails simply aggravate the situation."

**Current Post Parallel:**
- Comment section reflects "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism"
- Corruption allegations indicate relationship deterioration
- No evidence of professional standards in comment management
- Crux's "tragedy and the scandal" comment contributes to antagonistic tone

**Pattern Concern:**
- 2020: Council noted breakdown in professional relationship
- 2024: Comment section demonstrates continued/worsened antagonism
- Unmoderated platform amplifies rather than manages conflict

### Case 3356 (December 2022) - Media Council "Disappointed"

**Media Council Finding:**
"The Council is disappointed by Crux's conduct in this matter... Crux does not appear to have seriously engaged with Mr Tipene in relation to his specific complaints."

**Relevant Standard:**
"Even if other matters it is pursuing are verifiable and important that does not detract from its obligations in relation to other stories it publishes."

**Current Post Application:**
- While CEO recruitment may be legitimate public interest issue
- Does not excuse platform for unsubstantiated corruption allegations
- Public interest in governance does not override obligation to prevent defamation
- Comment moderation is separate obligation from article accuracy

---

## 5. PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS

### Legitimate Public Interest Elements

**YES - Strong Public Interest:**
1. **CEO Recruitment Process:**
   - Significant governance decision
   - Use of public funds
   - Timing relative to democratic transition
   - Questions about delegated authority

2. **Electoral Accountability:**
   - Election less than month away
   - Voters entitled to information about council decisions
   - Candidate transparency during campaign

3. **Transparency in Local Government:**
   - Secret committee processes (Performance Review Committee)
   - Public procurement procedures
   - Council decision-making authority

**Article Labeling:**
- Clearly marked "Opinion/Candidate Commentary"
- Author identified (councillor/candidate)
- Allows robust democratic debate

### Public Interest Does Not Justify

**NO - Not Protected by Public Interest:**
1. **Unsubstantiated Corruption Allegations:**
   - Criminal accusations without evidence
   - "Corruption" is serious legal allegation
   - Public interest in governance ≠ license for defamation

2. **Character Attacks:**
   - "Idiots," "disgusting," "deceitful"
   - Personal attacks distinct from policy criticism
   - Not necessary for informed democratic debate

3. **Unmoderated Election-Period Platform:**
   - Publisher responsibility for comment sections
   - Electoral integrity concerns
   - Amplification of inflammatory content during voting period

### Media Council Balance

**Preamble Recognition:**
"The proper fulfilment of that role requires a fundamental responsibility to maintain high standards of accuracy, fairness and balance and public faith in those standards."

**Application:**
- Public interest in CEO recruitment: YES
- Robust criticism of process: ACCEPTABLE
- Platform for criminal allegations without evidence: PROBLEMATIC
- Failure to moderate during election: CONCERNING

---

## 6. CONCLUSION

### NZMC Compliance Assessment

#### COMPLIANT:
- **Principle 6 (Headlines):** Post accurately summarized article and clearly labeled as opinion

#### POTENTIAL BREACHES:

**Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance):**
- **Severity:** MODERATE-HIGH
- **Issue:** Platform for unmoderated corruption allegations without evidence or right of reply
- **Evidence:** 6 comments containing corruption allegations/implications (12.2%)
- **Context:** Election period amplifies harm
- **Precedent:** Cases 2895, 2940 established social media standards

**Principle 4 (Comment and Fact):**
- **Severity:** MODERATE
- **Issue:** Crux's own comment used emotive language ("tragedy and the scandal") without clear editorial labeling
- **Evidence:** Line 102-104
- **Precedent:** Cases 2891, 2895 required clear distinction

### Pattern Analysis: Repeat Offending

**2020-2022 Complaints Pattern:**
1. Failure to distinguish comment from fact (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940)
2. Unprofessional social media conduct (Case 2895)
3. Deteriorating professional relationships (Case 2940)
4. Failure to seriously engage with standards (Case 3356)

**Current Post (2024):**
1. Crux comment mixes advocacy with factual reporting
2. No evidence of social media moderation standards
3. Platform amplifies antagonistic corruption allegations
4. Pattern suggests warnings not heeded

**Media Council's 2020 Warning:**
"The Council strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future"

**2024 Evidence:**
- 11 inflammatory comments (22.4%)
- 6 corruption allegations (12.2%)
- Single Crux comment using prejudicial language
- No visible moderation

### Recommendations

**For Potential Complaint:**
1. **Primary Ground:** Principle 1 - Platform moderation failure enabling defamation
2. **Secondary Ground:** Principle 4 - Crux comment mixing advocacy and fact
3. **Aggravating Factors:**
   - Election period timing
   - Pattern of repeat issues after warnings
   - Corruption allegations (criminal accusation)

**Strength Assessment:**
- **Moderate strength** on Principle 1 (platform responsibility for comments is complex area)
- **Weaker** on Principle 4 (single comment, article clearly labeled)
- **Strongest argument:** Pattern of disregard for previous warnings about social media standards

**Alternative Consideration:**
- Focus complaint on specific corruption allegations in comments
- Request Crux's comment moderation policy
- Emphasize election-period context and heightened duty of care
