Wānaka Chamber hires pro-Lewers editor for public debate

The Wānaka Chamber of Commerce has hired the Editor of the pro-Lewers, Queenstown based Mountain Scene community newspaper to front their public candidate debate on Tuesday, September 16.

Crux has lodged a formal complaint with the Chamber Chair Jo Learmonth and General Manager Glenn Peat over this decision (main image above).

Not only has there been what appears to be conspicuous editorial favouritism by the Mountain Scene in their support for the QLDC and mayor Lewers, but the Queenstown local paper has ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview while accepting over $200,000 in annual advertising payments from the QLDC each year. 

The Queenstown Chamber of Commerce made the decision to hire respected, out of town former journalist Katie Bradford for their candidate debate earlier this month.

Five current QLDC candidates - Barry Bruce, Lyal Cocks, Cody Tucker, Quentin Smith and Niki Gladding - are standing for the Wānaka-Upper Clutha Ward against four newcomers - Nicola King, Craig Gasson, Yeverley McCarthy and Thorsk Westphal. Only four of the nine will be elected on October 11.

Crux was planning to cover this September 16 event in Wānaka but we are now having to review that decision.


The Wānaka Chamber has also hosted "members only" debates relating to this local 2025 election campaign. 

We've suggested that a neutral Wānaka moderator would be more appropriate.
