CRUX Facebook September 27

Councillor Lisa Guy voted in favour of taking QLDC's water services to an external organisation - against 75% of public submissions. But months earlier her family business - Rationale - had provided paid advice to QLDC's mayor and management on the same subject. The Auditor-General says she should not have voted - and Mayor Lewers had to use his casting vote to push the move through. So does the vote now have to be taken again? Plus we reveal 2025 QLDC candidate Stephen Brent is the lawyer acting as trustee to Lisa Guy's Rationale shares.


Christina Dawson
A good family friend who was a very respected journalist, and who edited the Evening Post in Wellington for many years used to say, "believe half of what you hear and none of what you read". In other words, never take anything at face value.
I have been fairly critical of this current council and some of its councilors in the past. And I have had questions about Lisa Guy. Some based on her voting record and others based on stories from Crux and conversations with other people in our community.
What I would urge everyone to remember is that we never really know the full story and that some journalists sometimes have a Jack Russell type tendency to try and make thigh bones out of tidbits of scraps.
This week, I decided to take my questions directly to the source and had a sit down with Lisa. I'm a great believer in asking questions before leaping to conclusions. We have crossed paths a bit over the last few months especially during the UIV hearings in Arrowtown.
After having a really honest and frank discussion with Lisa and doing a bit of my own homework and some serious reflecting, I have reached my own conclusions and decided that I am still going to support Lisa this election.
That is not to say that I took everything she told me on complete trust. Nor am I convinced that she has voted the way I would have expected or wanted her to around the council table. BUT, everyone deserves a second chance and I personally don't believe all the insinuations about corruption that have been leveled against her. And I have a fairly good radar for that kind of thing. You'll just have to take my word for it on this but I have sniffed out a few rotten apples in my time.
I would like to see Lisa improve her engagement with her constituency. And if she is voted back in, it is my intention to work alongside her to help her do just that.
I would also add, that I believe that there is more than a faint aroma of Kool Aid about some of this journalist's articles. And, I am beginning to suspect, a hidden agenda of his own. Or at least a serious case of confirmation bias.

Christina Dawson there‚Äôs a lot of really wrong assumptions here - for instance we are not saying that Lisa is corrupt. We are saying she is deliberately blurring and confusing the issues around her ownership of Rationale. And just so you understand two other important aspects of journalism (in addition to your ‚Äúgood family friend‚Äù) we employed NZ‚Äôs top media barrister Robert Stewart KC to check through public records to ensure our analysis was 100% factual and correct re Lisa‚Äôs connection with Rationale. That‚Äôs how careful we have to be for legal reasons. Secondly - Lisa has tried hard to present a ‚Äúfolksy and innocent‚Äù image to the community - but her recent nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux), supported by mayor Lewers, tell an entirely different story. It‚Äôs so easy to attack a journalist for ‚Äúbias, assumptions, getting our facts wrong‚Äù but, like you, when it comes to proof - nothing happens. Nothing is presented. And yes, QLDC love to present us as being like a dog with a bone - obsessive. We are simply persistent until we get answers - that‚Äôs our job. Imagine the police getting criticised for being like a ‚Äúdog with a bone‚Äù in catching criminals - that‚Äôs what the community want from the police and from good journalism. With respect - we think your empty criticism has damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy.

Crux
Christina Dawson it‚Äôs important that you detail exactly what is wrong with our story - please detail that for us. This is essential as if you believe Lisa Guy then you must have some evidence to disbelieve Crux. We have no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness - so you must be saying that the QLDC, in spite of our reporting, has never lied to us and does not deserve the 17% - or more accurately 4% - trust rating in their own community survey? We are really looking forward to working with a new council where positive stories can be told and we can actually believe what the council comms team and all councillors tell us. That should a a given - not something new and novel.

Christina Dawson OK - it‚Äôs Sunday, please start listing the assumptions. We were able to help you with this story (link below) - so help us with some facts or assumptions in this story that you believe to be wrong.

Crux
Christina Dawson we are happy to start with just one wrong fact or assumption üëç

Crux
Christina Dawson from the article please - that‚Äôs what you are complaining about. False assumptions or facts from the article.

Ethically Guy should step aside now.

Judy Smith
Everyday there seems to be another shoddy wrong doing. I guess it has gone on for so long it just seems normalised to this council.

Vicki Black
Gosh...are the whole council untrustworthy!!!!!

Corruption all over, & probably just the tip of the iceberg, corruption is a cancer that if you don't cut it from the roots and everything that touched, it will just keep spreading and rotting the system.
Great work from the investigators and the team who is behind this article, they are brave enough to go deep into the sewer of the Corrupted Council and uncover this type of disgusting situations. More information like this should be spread, so we can take the right direction on the next election.

So much dodgy behavior in Queenstown
