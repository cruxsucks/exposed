Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor
This ODT article on the chief executive recruitment process makes one thing clear:
8 of 10 councillors have said they donâ€™t share the concerns being raised.
Councillors Matt Wong, Gavin Bartlett, Craig Ferguson, Melissa White, Barry Bruce, Cody Tucker, Lisa Guy and Lyal Cocks said they did not share any of Councillor Gladdingâ€™s concerns over the process to recruit a new chief executive to date. 
Instead, they stated her actions were frustrating, unnecessary and spread misinformation.  
This 'chorus' of councillors agree the recruitment has been transparent, fair, and above board.
From their perspective, theyâ€™ve been well informed, the use of a specialist recruiter is the right approach, and the process has been handled properly.
Instead of constant criticism and distraction we should be focused on stability and good governance.
Thatâ€™s been my position too.
This is about putting the right process in place so the next council can hit the ground running.

With respect Glyn this does not make what you did right in any way. It just means you and the ODT (funded by QLDC and local big business interests) are pushing the fact that many councillors donâ€™t actively object to what you did. Itâ€™s what the community (and Auditor-General) feels that counts - and if councillors are not representing the community then they are at risk of not getting re-elected.

Crux with respect Crux the ODT is privately owned

Cate Macdonald Yes - and your point is? Their revenue is now more from local councils than advertisers - they canâ€™t bite the hand that feeds them.

Crux I think the owners of ODT donâ€™t sink to your level of reporting

Cate Macdonald ðŸ˜³ for context you worked with Sothebys - the agents for Lakeview, a $100 million disaster for ratepayers but a bonanza for developers and wealthy real estate agents. The ODT has not mentioned the Lakeview scandal at all - are you so naive as to think thereâ€™s no connection between advertising and ODT editorial? Sink to our level of reporting - well thatâ€™s getting nasty! Very nasty! Not sure itâ€™s wise for you to be talking like this on social media Cate. Not wise at all. Plus thereâ€™s only two owners of the ODT - Sir Julian Smith and his brother. They are not journalists.
