Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor's Post

Throughout this campaign there have been plenty of assertions and shared opinion on QLDC’s performance – which people are entitled to do.
I did, however, think it might be helpful to put some facts into the debate.
On Friday, Niki Gladding shared an opinion piece about the recruitment process of QLDC’s new CEO. The subsequent support for Niki’s opinion piece from other Mayoral candidates and aspiring Councillors is concerning.
One Mayoral candidate subsequently issued a statement saying he “read with alarm” Niki’s claims. Being the Mayor requires a considered approach, and if people are prepared to jump into an inaccurate narrative, then I fear for what could unravel in the real world.
I am not here to comment on Niki’s views, but I am here to inform people of the facts.
When inaccurate and misleading information is shared, it is only appropriate for the public – including other mayoral candidates – to be aware of the correct information.
For those who have not read it – the opinion piece incorrectly suggests that as Mayor, my actions give a perception that I am “steering or controlling the recruitment”. That is patently false – Niki knows this, yet chooses to ignore the facts.
Niki also alleges four examples of me “showing little regard for good process” – in summary, these related to:
1. Political Donations
2. Lakeview
3. Being removed from council committee roles
4. Regional Deals
Let me address these in order, and provide the correct information:
CEO recruitment process
The Chief Executive recruitment is being carried out in line with QLDC’s established policies and the Local Government Act.
All that’s been done so far is appoint a recruiter through council process. That is, the delegated authority to procure an external recruitment firm sits with Council staff – not the CE Performance Review Committee, nor individual Councillors.
The opinion piece alleged that the CE Performance Review Committee (comprising myself, Cllrs Lisa Guy and Lyal Cocks) selected the recruitment consultancy “without delegation, mandate or notice to councillors”. This is untrue. A full and documented
procurement process was led by Council’s Procurement Manager and followed normal council procedures.
The recruitment process, whereby the position description is finalised and the job is advertised, hasn’t begun yet. As Niki knows, yet she chooses to disregard, this will also follow correct, standard procedure. The next step is for the recruiter to develop a programme regarding the process and timing for the recruitment, which will commence with the recruiter meeting with full council in the coming weeks. This is in line with Local Government New Zealand’s good practice guide on recruiting a Chief Executive.
The appointment of the Chief Executive will be made by full Council. This has always been the case. To suggest that this won’t be the case is misleading to the community, irresponsible and designed to disrupt.
· Further, over the weekend, A Mayoral candidate has received advice from four sitting councillors that the allegations made are false – that they are comfortable with the process so far, and it follows the same process used over the past 10 years. This demonstrates that this candidate is unable to listen and consider all views – especially if they challenge his own misinformed position.
· They have now doubled down and publicly berated an elected member who has provided a considered response to him. Instead of trying to work collaboratively and listening to what they have to say, we have seen a demonstration of a mayoral candidate who is incapable of building a team and/or creating a collaborative environment.
1. Political donations
Niki suggests there will be a conflict after I accepted a donation from Rod Drury to help pay for my election campaign.
· Accepting donations is legal and non-binding. If certain individuals want to support a candidate, then they are entitled to do so. Taking the ‘moral high ground’ on this is and turning it into a ‘scandal’ based on “potential conflict” is inaccurate. There is no conflict. The Regional Deals joint committee – comprising CODC, ORC and QLDC – is discussing how all modes of transport can be integrated seamlessly, agnostic to the type of mass rapid transport system that is eventually developed.
2. Lakeview
Claims I have deliberately blocked Niki’s motion to review the CEO’s Lakeview delegation.
· Niki’s actions indicate that she would like to rip up the contract without any just cause. These actions expose the ratepayer to potential legal challenge and significant cost. These risks were not addressed by Niki, and therefore under standing orders it was incumbent of me to reject the motion. Then, when the project was discussed with the new council earlier in the triennium, there was no further appetite from councillors to progress Niki’s views. This was not the first attempt from Niki, she tried this tactic under the previous Mayor. This relitigating of issues shows again and again, the cost to ratepayers of an individual’s crusade.

3. Being removed from council committee roles
Niki claims that the investigation process in the Code of Conduct breach was ignored. This matter relates to when she deliberately chose to breach confidentiality. A communication plan was in place, but Niki ‘jumped the gun’, ignored the agreed action and as a result caused major disruption and demonstrated once again that if her individual views are not adhered to, she will undermine the very organisation she is meant to help govern.
· The process to remove Niki from committees was a transparent democratic process that is allowed under the Local Government Act. There were 10 elected members who voted. Eight decided to remove her from committees. The two who did not also expressed their displeasure at Niki’s actions and believed that an investigation under a Code of Conduct charge would be better suited. However, neither of the two elected members were prepared to place a complaint.
· Niki shared confidential information and then used this confidential information to aid a third party – Aotearoa Water Action (AWA), which she is heavily involved with – in legal proceedings against the Council. The judgment of the Environment Court confirmed the information was indeed confidential. (Refer Decision No. [2025] NZEnvC 97 ). AWA was deemed to have no greater interest in the matter compared to the general public. This is a clear example of Niki not following process and undermining the public confidence for her own gain.
· Niki has still not acknowledged that she broke the trust and disrespected her fellow elected members, and continues to blame others for her removal without considering that her actions had a role to play.
4. Regional Deals
The opinion piece incorrectly claims that I “blocked” councillors’ access to Regional Deal Joint Committee papers and meetings.
· The Regional Deals joint committee is a group of two elected members across three councils (ORC, QLDC and CODC). My question, during this second meeting of the group, was to do with procedural votes needing consensus – not substantive items. The fact is, we reached consensus on information sharing and process during that meeting. Niki’s quote is again another example of misrepresentation.
· I am not the chair of the joint committee, and I do not set the parameters. I also do not write the papers, and I don’t see the papers until they are released to the rest of the joint committee. However, we are in negotiation. There is an expectation from Central Government that there is a level of confidentiality so negotiations can progress smoothly. To suggest that I am responsible for trying to withhold information from councillors is misleading and false.

For this election, it’s essential that people with the right experience, and those that have a solid grasp of correct local government process, get a seat at the council table.
I have the local government experience and understanding of what’s required, to ensure our district has the best chance of success as we grapple with our growing pains. I respectfully ask for your vote for a second term.
Let’s not leave it to chance – please do your research and make your vote count. Experience is essential.


Crux:
Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor a lot of your comments are subjective and not easily fact checked. Can you at least deliver details of exactly what you, Lisa Guy and Lyal Cocks have done re recruitment of a new CEO, what’s the procurement procedure, what’s the job description, which agency has been hired - and can the entire process be unwound if that’s the wish of a new council. It’s not enough for you and other councillors to “tell” the community things - we need documentary proof, because QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past. And that’s a fact.
