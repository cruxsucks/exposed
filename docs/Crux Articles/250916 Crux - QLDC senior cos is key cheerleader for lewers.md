Analysis.

One of the most powerful members of the Queenstown Lakes District Council’s communications team is acting as a highly public cheerleader for the re-election of Mayor Glyn Lewers.

Ben Scott is the council’s main Web and Digital Communications Advisor but the council says his widespread approval and participation in the online campaign to re-elect Mayor Lewers is acceptable as he is “acting as a private citizen.”

However, Mr Scott also shares and promotes virtually all of QLDC’s official projects and initiatives using the same personal social media accounts. And he’s happy to share that relationship.


The council’s Senior Democracy Services Advisor, and Deputy Electoral Officer, Jane Robertson supplied Crux with the following statment.

“I can confirm that Ben Scott is an employee of QLDC. Any post you saw was him acting as a private citizen. He was not using a Council account so his actions do not contravene any Council policy or electoral law.”


Mr Scott’s seniority in the QLDC’s management and communications team was evident from the minutes for the meeting that controversially stripped Councillor Niki Gladding of her committee roles for revealing the council’s then secret plans to discharge semi-treated sewage direct into the Shotover River.


Virtually every election campaign post from Glyn Lewers, on Facebook and LinkedIn, has been liked or even loved by Ben Scott, surely making it difficult for him to work with anyone, apart from Lewers, who is elected mayor on October 11.


It is also noteworthy that the other people supporting Glyn Lewers campaign online are mainly his own family members, his campaign PR advisor, Skyline’s Richard Thomas and various council suppliers.

In spite of Mr Scott’s senior position in the QLDC communications team, his prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports.

Crux has asked QLDC CEO Mike Theelen if he will take any action on Mr Scott’s personal involvement in Glyn Lewers election campaign given that, even though he might not technically be in breach of council rules, his actions seem quite ill-advised, to put it politely.
