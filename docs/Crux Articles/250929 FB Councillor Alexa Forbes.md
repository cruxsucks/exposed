Councillor Alexa Forbes
As we head into the last couple of weeks of this local election campaign, things are getting nastier in the QLDC election.  I haven’t voted yet, and likely won’t make my final decisions until a couple of days before elections close.  But I’m watching closely and not liking all that I see.  It’s certainly not making it easy for those who don’t have full working knowledge of the inside of our local council.  Least of all those voting for the first time.
Local elections should be about vision, competence, and trust. A contest of ideas. Yet in Queenstown Lakes this election is more about personal attacks on Mayor Glyn Lewers and processes that few of us can digest or competently judge.  It’s delving deep into murky territory that breeds distrust and division, where at least a certain amount of trust and cohesion is evidenced by the silence on these issues from the majority of councillors.   Critiques are fair, attacks are not. Glyn and his council have steered us in difficult times and, as a first term Mayor, he will have had to learn some extremely difficult lessons on the job. 
None of this is to say that the Mayor or others are above scrutiny. Robust debate on housing, infrastructure, rates, and climate resilience is essential. But the line between accountability and personal smear must be held.  When campaigns focus on insinuation and processes that are opaque to most, rather than on ideas, we all lose: voters are left with noise instead of clarity, and capable people discouraged from serving their communities.
So let’s hold our mayor to account where it counts—on policy, delivery, and transparency.  Let’s respect the work he has done on our behalf in an increasingly difficult time.  My vote won’t follow anyone who personally attacks.

Crux
Sadly Alexa things are far more serious than you like to think. You know my background and in a global career I never seen such blatant disregard for truth, integrity and public service as at QLDC under Boult, Lewers and the ever present Meaghan Miller. It’s not my imagination either - hundreds of LGOIMA requests eventually proved that multiple council staff, from the top down lied about procurement and jobs for mates and for months in 2024/2025 the tragic and long standing illegal dumping of partially treated sewage was denied by the mayor, local MP, CEO and senior engineering staff. NZ can’t be the “land of no consequences” unless it wants to sink gradually into corruption and obscurity. Journalism will disappear unless we hold power to account - and my god it’s not easy against a well resourced council that won’t respect the fourth estate or the community. Your “let’s be friends with everyone” is laudable in theory - but in the real world, especially the Southern Lakes where Big Money comes face to face every day with a fragile natural environment, I’m sorry but dream on! It’s a measure of society’s maturity how we handle conflict and resolve differences - mayor Boult, Lewers, council bosses Theelen and Miller use the famous and deadly global advice to the insurance companies from consultants Mackinsey on how to increase their already huge profits - Delay, Deny, Defend. That’s not democracy and its not an approach to integrity that I or thousands of others want from this wonderful and unique community.
