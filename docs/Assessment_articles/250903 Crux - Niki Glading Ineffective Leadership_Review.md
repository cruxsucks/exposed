# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Niki Gladding: Ineffective leadership the cause of QLDC dysfunction
**Publication:** Crux
**Date:** September 3, 2025
**Author:** Amanda Robertshawe
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This article presents a one-sided interview with QLDC Councillor Niki Gladding during an election period where she is seeking a third term. The article lacks balance, fairness, and fails to provide opposing viewpoints or right of reply to those criticized. Multiple NZMC principles appear to have been breached, particularly regarding accuracy, fairness and balance (Principle 1), and the distinction between fact and comment (Principle 4).

---

## Article Summary
The article is structured as an interview profile of Niki Gladding, a QLDC councillor seeking re-election to represent the Wanaka-Upper Clutha Ward. The article presents Gladding's perspective on:
- Her decision to seek a third term despite council toxicity
- Her attribution of council dysfunction to "ineffective leadership" by the mayor
- Her move from Glenorchy to Wanaka and ability to represent a different ward
- Her lack of political ideology and pragmatic approach
- Her whistleblowing on the Shotover River sewage discharge issue and subsequent censure
- Her criticisms of the Chief Executive and council management
- Her detailed policy proposals for council reform if re-elected
- Her views on trust deficits between elected members and staff

The article presents exclusively Gladding's narrative and perspectives without seeking comment from those she criticizes, including Mayor Glyn Lewers, Chief Executive Mike Theelen, or other councillors.

---

## Context Considerations
ReviewContext.MD is currently empty. However, the article itself makes clear this is published during an election period, with Gladding explicitly seeking a third term on council. This electoral context heightens the importance of balance and fairness, as the article functions as campaign publicity for a candidate making serious allegations against incumbent officials and proposing herself as the solution.

The article references Gladding seeking re-election to a different ward (Wanaka-Upper Clutha), having recently moved from Glenorchy. This constituency change is relevant context that affects how voters might evaluate her candidacy.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**
The article presents several claims as fact without verification:
- That Mayor Lewers provided "ineffective leadership" (lines 20-22) - presented as established fact rather than Gladding's opinion
- That the Chief Executive showed "disrespect for our governance role" (line 59) - Gladding's characterization presented without context
- That "half of the Councillors signed my Notice of Motion" regarding Lakeview delegation (line 71) - no verification or context about why other councillors "backed down"
- That the CE "plans to discharge sewage into the Shotover River" (line 53) - misleading framing of what was described as emergency powers for wastewater discharge

The article fails to clarify what constitutes verified fact versus Gladding's interpretations and opinions.

**Fairness Issues:**
The article is fundamentally unfair to those criticized:
- Mayor Glyn Lewers is blamed for "ineffective leadership" and accused of crushing Gladding's motions and "pulling out the lawyers" (lines 20-22, 71) without opportunity to respond
- Chief Executive Mike Theelen is accused of showing "disrespect," planning environmental damage, and controlling problematic areas (lines 53-59, 89-104) without right of reply
- Other councillors are characterized as having "backed down" and being "nodding heads" (lines 71, 112) without their perspectives
- Council staff are characterized as having developed systems "with QLDC in mind" rather than ratepayers (line 88)

None of these criticized parties were given opportunity to respond or provide context.

**Balance Issues:**
The article is entirely one-sided:
- No alternative perspectives on council dynamics or causes of dysfunction
- No comment from the mayor, CE, other councillors, or council staff
- No independent assessment of Gladding's claims or track record
- No exploration of counterarguments to her positions
- No context about why she was censured by fellow councillors beyond her own framing

The article functions as an uncritical platform for a political candidate's campaign narrative during an election period.

**Evidence:**
"In Gladding's estimation, the reason for the difficulties was, largely, ineffective leadership." (line 20) - This serious allegation is presented as her view but the article treats it as analytical finding rather than political claim.

"We didn't get that from the mayor, and no one was able to step into the void." (line 22) - Direct criticism without right of reply.

"Mike (Theelen, Chief Executive) telling us he was going to use emergency powers to discharge wastewater into the Shotover was one of the worst moments of my time on Council." (line 55) - Serious allegation about environmental damage without CE's explanation of emergency circumstances or regulatory context.

"It was in that moment that the staff's level of disrespect for our governance role really hit home." (line 59) - Gladding's interpretation presented without staff perspective.

"Glyn (Lewers, the Mayor) pulled out the lawyers, and the consultants, and the other councillors backed down." (line 71) - Mayor characterized negatively without explanation of legal concerns that may have been legitimate.

The entire final third of the article (lines 85-119) consists of Gladding's detailed policy proposals presented uncritically, functioning as free campaign advertising.

**Findings:**
This article constitutes a clear breach of Principle 1. It is a one-sided electoral profile that fails to provide balance, gives no fair voice to opposition views or those criticized, and does not meet basic standards of fairness. While exceptions exist for "long-running issues," this is a discrete article about a specific candidate and specific allegations that require balance. The article's timing during an election period makes this breach particularly serious, as it provides substantial campaign benefit to one candidate while denying fairness to others.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The article systematically fails to distinguish between factual information and Gladding's opinions/interpretations:

**Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**
- "Ineffective leadership" (line 20) - Opinion presented as causal explanation
- Council "toxicity" (line 13) - Characterization presented as established fact
- CE's "disrespect for our governance role" (line 59) - Gladding's subjective interpretation presented as fact
- "We didn't get that [good leadership] from the mayor" (line 22) - Political criticism presented as assessment
- Systems "developed by QLDC with QLDC in mind" rather than ratepayers (line 88) - Opinion presented as fact

**Lack of Clear Identification:**
The article is not clearly labeled as opinion, column, or interview. It appears in news format ("by Amanda Robertshawe") and uses journalistic third-person framing in places, creating appearance of objective reporting while functioning as opinion platform.

**Factual Foundation:**
Many opinions lack proper factual foundation:
- Claim that "half of the Councillors signed my Notice of Motion" (line 71) - not verified with council records or named councillors
- Assertion about mayor crushing motions - no specific examples or documentation cited
- Claims about CE controlling "problem areas" - no evidence provided beyond Gladding's assertion

**Evidence:**

"In Gladding's estimation, the reason for the difficulties was, largely, ineffective leadership." (line 20) - This frames opinion as analytical finding.

"To what does Gladding attribute the very conspicuous toxic environment that has developed in the QLDC?" (line 77) - The question assumes as fact that the environment is "very conspicuous[ly] toxic" without establishing this independently.

"It appears there's a great deal of work ahead for Niki Gladding, if she's wins sufficient votes for a third term." (line 119) - Editorial comment suggesting her work is necessary/valuable.

The article oscillates between direct quotes (Gladding's obvious opinions) and third-person narrative that blurs whether claims are Gladding's views or established facts. For example: "Gladding appears to have developed a keen understanding of the processes necessary to hold Council management to account and has done so on many occasions." (line 43) - This is editorial endorsement, not fact.

**Findings:**
The article breaches Principle 4 by failing to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion. While it's structured around Gladding's quoted statements, the framing, context-setting, and third-person narrative frequently present her opinions as facts or analytical findings. The article should have been clearly labeled as an opinion piece, interview profile, or candidate feature, with clearer distinction between verified facts and Gladding's political perspectives.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**
The article is not clearly identified as opinion, column, or editorial content. It carries a byline ("by Amanda Robertshawe - Sep 03, 2025") suggesting news reporting, and uses a news article format. There is no label such as "Opinion," "Interview," "Profile," or "Candidate Feature" that would signal to readers this is not straight news reporting.

While readers might understand this is based on an interview given the extensive quotes, it's not "widely understood to consist largely of the writer's own opinions" - rather, it presents one subject's opinions in a news-like format.

**Foundation of Fact:**
Even if treated as opinion content, the article has weaknesses in factual foundation:
- Claims about councillor votes and positions are not independently verified
- Allegations against the mayor and CE lack supporting documentation
- Historical claims (Ombudsman reports, Alliance review, etc.) are referenced but not detailed with dates, findings, or links
- The censure of Gladding is mentioned but not fully explained with the council's reasoning

**Balance Requirement:**
Principle 5 notes "with comment and opinion balance is not essential." However, this article occupies a gray area - it's not clearly labeled opinion, and it's not purely Gladding's opinion piece. It's a journalistic interview/profile that presents one candidate's views during an election. The lack of balance might be acceptable for a clearly-labeled opinion column but is problematic for what appears to be news content.

**Evidence:**

The article header shows: "by Amanda Robertshawe - Sep 03, 2025" (line 3) - standard news byline format, not opinion column identification.

No visual or textual indicators identify this as opinion, interview feature, or candidate profile rather than news reporting.

The third-person framing includes editorial judgments: "Gladding appears to have developed a keen understanding of the processes necessary to hold Council management to account" (line 43) - this is the author's opinion, not clearly attributed or labeled.

**Findings:**
If this article were clearly labeled as an opinion piece, interview feature, or candidate profile, many of the balance concerns under Principle 1 might be mitigated. However, because it presents in news format without clear identification as opinion content, it cannot claim the protection of Principle 5. This constitutes a potential breach - the article should have been clearly labeled to help readers understand they are reading one candidate's political perspectives, not balanced news reporting.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "Niki Gladding: Ineffective leadership the cause of QLDC dysfunction"

**Accuracy Assessment:**
This headline presents as fact Gladding's opinion. While the article does contain Gladding stating "the reason for the difficulties was, largely, ineffective leadership" (line 20), the headline removes the attribution and presents this political opinion as established fact.

A more accurate headline would be:
- "Niki Gladding blames ineffective leadership for QLDC dysfunction"
- "Gladding: Mayor's leadership caused council dysfunction"
- "Councillor Gladding criticizes mayor's leadership in re-election bid"

**Misleading Elements:**
The headline misleads readers by:
1. Presenting opinion as fact
2. Omitting that this is one candidate's campaign perspective
3. Failing to signal this is about an election candidate seeking a third term
4. Giving appearance of analytical article rather than interview/profile

**Substance Reflection:**
The headline does reflect a key element of the article - Gladding's attribution of council problems to leadership failures. However, it fails to convey:
- That this is an election candidate's perspective
- That this is disputed/opinion rather than established finding
- That the article is an interview/profile, not investigative reporting
- That those criticized were not given opportunity to respond

**Evidence:**

Headline: "Niki Gladding: Ineffective leadership the cause of QLDC dysfunction" (line 2)

The use of the colon after "Niki Gladding" is ambiguous - it could signal attribution (Gladding's view) or simply indicate this article is about Gladding. The latter interpretation is more natural, making the headline read as factual claim.

Compare to article content: "In Gladding's estimation, the reason for the difficulties was, largely, ineffective leadership." (line 20) - The article properly attributes this as Gladding's view, but the headline does not.

**Findings:**
The headline breaches Principle 6 by failing to accurately convey that the claim about "ineffective leadership" is Gladding's opinion rather than established fact. The headline gives readers the impression of an analytical article establishing leadership failure as fact, when the content is actually a one-sided interview with an election candidate making political criticisms. The headline should have included clear attribution to signal this is Gladding's political perspective, not verified reporting.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Electoral Context:**
This article is published during an election period (September 3, 2025) when Gladding is actively seeking re-election. The article functions as campaign publicity, providing:
- A platform to criticize her political opponents (mayor, CE)
- Extensive detail on her policy proposals (lines 85-119)
- Positive framing of her "whistleblowing" and censure
- Portrayal as lone voice for democracy and transparency
- Free media exposure worth significant campaign value

**Disclosure Requirements:**
The article should disclose:
- That this is published during an election period
- That Gladding is a candidate seeking re-election
- The electoral context that affects how readers should interpret the content

While the article mentions Gladding "seeking a third term" (line 11), this is mentioned once in passing and not framed as the relevant context for understanding the entire article.

**Author-Subject Relationship:**
No information is provided about:
- How this interview was arranged
- Whether the author has any relationship to Gladding or her campaign
- Whether Crux has editorial policies about election coverage balance
- Whether other candidates were offered similar platforms

**Sponsorship/Inducement:**
While there's no suggestion of financial inducement, the article provides substantial campaign benefit to Gladding by:
- Giving uncritical platform to attack opponents
- Presenting detailed policy platform
- Framing her as reform-minded public servant
- Providing no balancing coverage of criticized parties or other candidates

**Evidence:**

"It's no secret that Councillor Niki Gladding has been in two minds about seeking a third term on QLDC." (line 11) - This mentions the electoral context but doesn't frame the article as election coverage.

If successful, Gladding will represent a different Ward next term." (line 27) - Electoral context mentioned but not emphasized.

"It appears there's a great deal of work ahead for Niki Gladding, if she's wins sufficient votes for a third term." (line 119) - The conclusion implies her election would be valuable, constituting editorial endorsement.

The article provides approximately 1,800 words of largely uncritical coverage of a political candidate during an election, functioning as campaign advertising without being labeled as such.

**Findings:**
The article constitutes a potential breach of Principle 10 by failing to adequately disclose the electoral context and the campaign benefit provided to Gladding. While the article mentions she's seeking re-election, it doesn't frame the piece as election coverage or apply the balance and fairness standards appropriate to electoral journalism. The substantial campaign benefit provided - platform to criticize opponents, extensive policy detail, positive framing - should have been balanced with right of reply or clearly labeled as paid/sponsored content if it was intended as campaign publicity. At minimum, the article should have been clearly labeled as election candidate profile with disclosure of the electoral context.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise privacy concerns. All individuals named (Gladding, Mayor Lewers, CE Theelen) are public officials engaged in public roles. The matters discussed relate to public council business and governance, which are clearly matters of public interest and public record.

Gladding's personal move from Glenorchy to Wanaka is mentioned (line 27) but is relevant to her electoral candidacy for a different ward and is not an invasion of privacy.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical/mental disability. While it features a female politician, gender is not gratuitously emphasized or made relevant to the coverage.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article does not appear to rely on confidential sources. All information is attributed to Gladding speaking on the record. No confidentiality issues arise.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. It appears to be a straightforward interview with Gladding.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text provided does not include photographs or graphics details. Cannot assess from available information.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The article is fundamentally one-sided, providing no fair voice to opposition views or those criticized (mayor, CE, other councillors, staff). During an election period, this one-sided coverage provides substantial campaign benefit to one candidate while denying fairness to others. The article presents Gladding's political opinions and criticisms as fact without verification or balance.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The article fails to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion. Gladding's political perspectives and criticisms are frequently presented as analytical findings or established facts rather than being clearly identified as her views. The article is not clearly labeled as opinion content.

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - BREACH**: The headline presents Gladding's opinion ("ineffective leadership the cause of QLDC dysfunction") as fact by removing clear attribution. The headline misleads readers about the nature of the content, suggesting analytical reporting rather than one candidate's political perspective.

4. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion, interview, or candidate profile content. It uses news format without clear labeling that would help readers understand they are reading political opinion rather than balanced reporting.

5. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article fails to adequately disclose and frame the electoral context, providing substantial campaign benefit to Gladding without applying appropriate balance standards for election coverage or clearly labeling the piece as candidate publicity.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

While this is a single article review, several concerning patterns are evident:

1. **Uncritical Platform**: The article provides an uncritical platform for political criticism and campaign messaging without journalistic scrutiny or balance.

2. **Opinion as Fact**: Throughout the article, there is a pattern of presenting Gladding's political opinions and characterizations as factual findings or analytical conclusions.

3. **Absence of Right of Reply**: Multiple individuals and groups are criticized (mayor, CE, other councillors, council staff) without any being given opportunity to respond or provide context.

4. **Electoral Advantage**: The article provides substantial electoral advantage to one candidate through:
   - Platform to criticize opponents
   - Detailed presentation of policy platform
   - Positive framing of controversial actions (whistleblowing, censure)
   - Portrayal as reform-minded public servant
   - No balancing coverage of other candidates or criticized parties

5. **Genre Confusion**: The article sits uneasily between news reporting (byline, format, third-person framing) and opinion/interview content (one-sided, uncritical), creating confusion about how readers should interpret the content.

If this pattern extends to other Crux coverage of the QLDC election, it would raise serious questions about the publication's commitment to fair and balanced electoral journalism.

---

**Electoral Context:**

This article's publication during an election period where Gladding is seeking re-election has several critical implications:

1. **Campaign Benefit**: The article provides substantial benefit to Gladding's campaign by:
   - Giving her a platform to attack incumbent mayor and CE
   - Presenting her detailed policy platform uncritically
   - Framing her as a principled reformer standing up for democracy
   - Providing approximately 1,800 words of largely positive coverage
   - Reaching Crux's readership without campaign spending

2. **Unfair Electoral Advantage**: By denying right of reply to those criticized and providing no balancing coverage of:
   - The mayor's perspective on council dynamics
   - The CE's explanation of emergency wastewater decisions
   - Other councillors' views on governance issues
   - Other candidates in the Wanaka-Upper Clutha race

   The article creates unfair electoral advantage for Gladding.

3. **Voter Deception**: Voters reading this article may believe they are reading balanced news reporting about council dysfunction and reform needs, when they are actually reading one candidate's campaign messaging. This undermines informed democratic choice.

4. **Electoral Integrity**: Fair election coverage requires either:
   - Balance within articles (presenting multiple candidates' views)
   - Balance across coverage (similar platforms for all candidates)
   - Clear labeling of candidate publicity as such

   This article achieves none of these.

5. **Heightened Standards**: Electoral journalism requires heightened attention to fairness and balance because of the direct impact on democratic outcomes. The NZMC preamble states "An independent press plays a vital role in a democracy" - this article fails to fulfill that role by providing one-sided campaign publicity disguised as news.

The electoral timing transforms what might be a significant but standard breach into a serious failure of democratic journalism that potentially affects electoral outcomes and voter choice.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are strong grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The article fails to give fair voice to opposition views or those criticized. Specific grounds:
   - No right of reply given to Mayor Glyn Lewers regarding allegations of "ineffective leadership" and "crushing" motions
   - No opportunity for CE Mike Theelen to explain emergency wastewater decision or respond to accusations of "disrespect"
   - No perspectives from other councillors accused of "backing down" or being "nodding heads"
   - No balancing views on causes of council dysfunction
   - One-sided electoral coverage providing unfair campaign benefit

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The article fails to clearly distinguish between factual information and opinion. Specific grounds:
   - Political opinions about "ineffective leadership" presented as causal facts
   - Gladding's characterizations ("disrespect," "toxicity") presented as established facts
   - Article not clearly labeled as opinion or interview content
   - Third-person framing creates false appearance of objective reporting

3. **Principle 6 - Headlines and Captions**: The headline presents opinion as fact. Specific grounds:
   - Headline states "Ineffective leadership the cause of QLDC dysfunction" as fact without clear attribution
   - Misleads readers about content being analytical rather than one candidate's political perspective
   - Fails to signal electoral context or interview format

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 5 - Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion content despite functioning as such.

5. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: The article fails to adequately disclose electoral context and campaign benefit provided.

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Lack of Balance - Direct Criticism Without Right of Reply:**
   - "In Gladding's estimation, the reason for the difficulties was, largely, ineffective leadership. 'We didn't get that from the mayor, and no one was able to step into the void.'" (lines 20-22) - Direct criticism of mayor without his response
   - "Mike (Theelen, Chief Executive) telling us he was going to use emergency powers to discharge wastewater into the Shotover was one of the worst moments of my time on Council." (line 55) - Serious allegation without CE's explanation
   - "Glyn (Lewers, the Mayor) pulled out the lawyers, and the consultants, and the other councillors backed down. I still don't understand why." (lines 71-72) - Mayor characterized negatively without opportunity to explain legal concerns

2. **Opinion Presented as Fact:**
   - Headline: "Niki Gladding: Ineffective leadership the cause of QLDC dysfunction" - Opinion stated as fact
   - "To what does Gladding attribute the very conspicuous toxic environment that has developed in the QLDC?" (line 77) - Question assumes "conspicuous toxic environment" as fact
   - "Gladding appears to have developed a keen understanding of the processes necessary to hold Council management to account and has done so on many occasions." (line 43) - Editorial endorsement presented as fact

3. **Electoral Context - Campaign Benefit:**
   - Extensive policy platform detail (lines 85-119) functioning as free campaign advertising
   - Positive framing of whistleblowing and censure as principled stand
   - "It appears there's a great deal of work ahead for Niki Gladding, if she's wins sufficient votes for a third term." (line 119) - Editorial suggestion her election is needed/valuable
   - Approximately 1,800 words of largely uncritical coverage during election period

4. **No Clear Labeling:**
   - Byline "by Amanda Robertshawe - Sep 03, 2025" (line 3) suggests news reporting
   - No label identifying content as "Opinion," "Interview," "Profile," or "Candidate Feature"
   - Third-person framing creates appearance of objective reporting

5. **Unverified Claims:**
   - "Half of the Councillors signed my Notice of Motion" (line 71) - not verified with council records or named councillors
   - Claims about mayor "crushing" motions - no specific examples documented
   - Characterizations of CE and staff "disrespect" - no supporting evidence beyond Gladding's view

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of the decision with fair prominence in the section where original article ran

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for:
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers
   - CE Mike Theelen
   - Other councillors criticized

   To be given fair prominence similar to original article

4. **Correction/Retraction**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Article failed to provide balance or right of reply
   - Claims about "ineffective leadership" are Gladding's political opinion, not established fact
   - Article should have been labeled as opinion/interview content
   - Electoral context should have been prominently disclosed

5. **Process Improvements**: Request Crux establish clear editorial policies for:
   - Electoral coverage requiring balance
   - Clear labeling of opinion vs. news content
   - Mandatory right of reply when individuals are criticized
   - Disclosure of conflicts of interest and electoral context

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Timing is Critical**: The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher is October 3, 2025 - immediate action required.

2. **Public Interest**: This complaint serves public interest by:
   - Protecting electoral integrity and fair campaign coverage
   - Ensuring voters receive balanced information for democratic choice
   - Holding media accountable for electoral journalism standards
   - Protecting reputations of unfairly criticized public officials

3. **Standing**: Consider who should bring complaint:
   - Mayor Lewers (directly criticized)
   - CE Mike Theelen (directly criticized)
   - Other councillors (characterized as backing down/nodding heads)
   - Community member concerned about electoral fairness
   - NZMC will consider third-party complaints but may require consent from affected individuals

4. **Pattern Evidence**: If pursuing complaint, investigate whether:
   - Crux has published similar one-sided coverage of other candidates
   - Mayor Lewers or other candidates were offered similar platforms
   - This is part of pattern of unfair electoral coverage
   - Other articles show similar breaches of NZMC principles

5. **Electoral Impact**: Document potential electoral impact:
   - Campaign value of approximately 1,800 words of coverage
   - Reach of Crux publication in Queenstown-Wanaka area
   - Timing (early in campaign period maximizes impact)
   - Whether article influenced voter perceptions or discourse

6. **Broader Reform**: This complaint could serve as precedent for:
   - Clearer NZMC guidance on electoral journalism
   - Industry standards for campaign coverage labeling
   - Right of reply protocols during election periods
   - Disclosure requirements for candidate features

**Key Principles Applied in This Review:**

1. **Evidence-Based**: All breach findings cite specific passages from article
2. **Proportionate**: Distinguishes between clear breaches, potential breaches, and compliant content
3. **Contextual**: Considers electoral timing and public interest implications
4. **Practical**: Provides actionable recommendations for complaint process
5. **Balanced**: Acknowledges freedom of expression while upholding ethical standards

**Conclusion:**

This article represents a significant failure of journalistic standards, particularly in the electoral context. The combination of one-sided coverage, failure to distinguish fact from opinion, misleading headline, inadequate disclosure of electoral context, and denial of right of reply to those criticized constitutes multiple breaches of NZMC principles.

The article's primary function appears to be providing a campaign platform for Niki Gladding rather than informing voters through balanced journalism. This undermines electoral integrity and denies readers the balanced information necessary for informed democratic choice.

A formal complaint is warranted and should be pursued urgently given the one-month deadline for complaining to the publisher. The complaint serves not only to address this specific article but to establish important precedents for electoral journalism standards in New Zealand.
