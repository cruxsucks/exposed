# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Wanaka Chamber hires pro-Lewers editor for public debate
**Publication:** Crux
**Date:** September 13, 2025
**Author:** Peter Newport
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This article presents allegations that the Wanaka Chamber of Commerce has made an inappropriate choice in hiring a "pro-Lewers" editor to moderate a candidate debate. The article makes serious accusations about media bias and financial conflicts of interest but fails to provide supporting evidence, denies right of reply to those criticized, and presents opinion as fact. Multiple NZMC principles appear to have been breached, particularly regarding accuracy, fairness and balance (Principle 1), the distinction between fact and comment (Principle 4), and conflicts of interest (Principle 10).

## Breach Summary (NZMC)
- P1 Accuracy/Fairness/Balance — Breach
- P4 Comment vs Fact — Breach
- P6 Headlines — Breach
- P5 Opinion Identification — Potential Breach
- P10 Conflicts of Interest — Potential Breach

## Article Summary
The article is a short news report (approximately 200 words) that:
- States the Wanaka Chamber has hired "the Editor of the pro-Lewers, Queenstown based Mountain Scene community newspaper" to moderate their public candidate debate on September 16
- Claims Crux has lodged a formal complaint with Chamber officials over this decision
- Alleges Mountain Scene has shown "conspicuous editorial favouritism" toward QLDC and Mayor Lewers
- Claims Mountain Scene has "ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview"
- States Mountain Scene accepts "over $200,000 in annual advertising payments from the QLDC each year"
- Notes the Queenstown Chamber hired an "out of town former journalist Katie Bradford" for their debate
- Lists the nine candidates running for four Wanaka-Upper Clutha Ward seats
- States Crux is "having to review" whether to cover the September 16 event
- Notes the Wanaka Chamber has also hosted "members only" debates
- Suggests "a neutral Wanaka moderator would be more appropriate"

The article provides no quotes from, or opportunity for response by, the Wanaka Chamber of Commerce, Mountain Scene, its editor, or Mayor Lewers.

## Context Considerations
The ReviewContext.MD file indicates this article is published during the ongoing Queenstown Lakes District Council local government elections. The article itself confirms this electoral context, with nine candidates competing for four council seats, and the election date of October 11, 2025.

The article references a candidate debate scheduled for September 16 - just three days after publication - suggesting urgency but also raising questions about whether this timing denied those criticized adequate opportunity to respond before the event.

The broader context from historical NZMC complaints shows Crux has a pattern of tense relationships with QLDC entities and has been previously found in breach for failing to distinguish fact from opinion and for inadequate right of reply.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

Evidence Atoms:
- [E-P1-001] “pro-Lewers” characterization stated as fact without sourcing — opinion presented as fact (Accuracy/Balance).
- [E-P1-002] “over $200,000 in annual advertising payments from the QLDC each year” — specific financial claim stated without source (Accuracy).
- [E-P1-003] “ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview” — absolute coverage claim without verification (Accuracy/Balance).

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**
The article makes several serious factual claims without verification or evidence:

- That Mountain Scene is "pro-Lewers" (line 7) - This is a characterization/opinion presented as established fact. No evidence is provided of what makes the publication "pro-Lewers."

- That there has been "conspicuous editorial favouritism by the Mountain Scene in their support for the QLDC and mayor Lewers" (line 11) - The word "conspicuous" suggests this is obvious and proven, yet no specific examples of biased coverage are cited.

- That Mountain Scene has "ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview" (line 11) - This is stated as fact without evidence. Did Mountain Scene cover these issues at all? Was their coverage inadequate? The article provides no documentation or analysis.

- That Mountain Scene accepts "over $200,000 in annual advertising payments from the QLDC each year" (line 11) - This specific financial claim is stated as fact but is not sourced. Is this based on public records, financial statements, council budgets? The lack of sourcing makes it impossible to verify.

The article presents these claims with certainty but provides no evidence, documentation, or verification of any kind.

**Fairness Issues:**
The article is fundamentally unfair to multiple parties who are denied right of reply:

- **Mountain Scene and its editor** are accused of bias, favoritism, ignoring important issues, and financial conflicts of interest without opportunity to respond. The editor is not named but is identified by position, making this a direct personal attack on their professional integrity.

- **The Wanaka Chamber of Commerce** (specifically Chair Jo Learmonth and General Manager Glenn Peat, line 9) are criticized for their hiring decision without opportunity to explain their selection criteria or defend their choice.

- **Mayor Lewers** is implicated in the allegations of media favoritism and financial influence without opportunity to respond.

- **QLDC** is accused of using advertising payments to influence media coverage - a serious corruption allegation - without right of reply.

None of these parties were apparently contacted for comment before publication, despite the serious nature of the allegations.

**Balance Issues:**
The article is entirely one-sided:
- No explanation of why the Chamber chose this particular moderator
- No details about the moderator's qualifications or experience
- No response from Mountain Scene about their editorial coverage or independence
- No context about QLDC advertising spending practices (do they advertise in all local publications?)
- No evidence supporting the claim of bias
- No alternative perspectives on whether the moderator choice is appropriate

The article presents only Crux's perspective and allegations, with no balancing information or opposing views.

**Evidence:**

"The Wanaka Chamber of Commerce has hired the Editor of the pro-Lewers, Queenstown based Mountain Scene community newspaper to front their public candidate debate" (line 7) - The characterization "pro-Lewers" is editorial opinion stated as fact in what appears to be objective news reporting.

"Not only has there been what appears to be conspicuous editorial favouritism by the Mountain Scene in their support for the QLDC and mayor Lewers" (line 11) - The phrase "what appears to be" provides minimal hedge, but "conspicuous editorial favouritism" is a serious allegation stated as virtual fact without supporting evidence.

"[Mountain Scene has] ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview while accepting over $200,000 in annual advertising payments from the QLDC each year" (line 11) - This implies a quid pro quo corruption arrangement (advertising payments in exchange for favorable coverage) without evidence or right of reply.

"We've suggested that a neutral Wanaka moderator would be more appropriate" (line 22) - This implies the chosen moderator is not neutral, reinforcing the bias allegation, again without supporting evidence or opposing views.

**Findings:**
This article constitutes a clear breach of Principle 1. It makes serious allegations about media bias, professional misconduct, and potential corruption without providing evidence and without giving fair opportunity for response to those criticized. The accusations of favoritism, ignoring important issues, and financial conflicts of interest are presented as established facts rather than as Crux's unverified allegations. The article's timing during an election period, and just three days before the debate, makes this breach particularly serious as it could influence public perception and the Chamber's decision-making without allowing those criticized adequate time to respond.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The article systematically fails to distinguish between factual information and Crux's opinions/interpretations:

**Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**
- "Pro-Lewers" editor (line 7) - Opinion/characterization presented as fact
- "Conspicuous editorial favouritism" (line 11) - Opinion about media coverage presented as established fact
- Mountain Scene has "ignored key issues" (line 11) - Opinion about coverage adequacy presented as fact
- The implication that accepting advertising creates bias - Opinion about journalistic ethics presented as fact
- "Neutral Wanaka moderator would be more appropriate" (line 22) - Opinion about what is appropriate presented as self-evident conclusion

**Lack of Clear Identification:**
The article is not labeled as opinion, column, or editorial. It carries Peter Newport's byline with a date ("by Peter Newport - Sep 13, 2025") suggesting news reporting, not opinion. There is no label such as "Opinion," "Editorial," or "Comment" that would signal to readers this represents Crux's perspective rather than objective reporting.

The article does use first-person ("We've suggested," line 22), which signals opinion, but this comes after multiple statements presented as facts, creating confusion about the article's genre.

**Factual Foundation:**
The opinions and accusations lack proper factual foundation:
- No specific examples of "pro-Lewers" coverage by Mountain Scene are cited
- No analysis or comparison of Mountain Scene's coverage vs. other publications
- No documentation of the alleged $200,000+ in advertising payments
- No evidence that Mountain Scene "ignored" the sewage crisis or Lakeview issues (Did they not cover these at all? Or did they cover them but Crux disagrees with the coverage?)
- No citation of journalistic ethics standards that would make accepting advertising from a government entity automatically problematic

**Evidence:**

"The Wanaka Chamber of Commerce has hired the Editor of the pro-Lewers, Queenstown based Mountain Scene community newspaper" (line 7) - Opening sentence presents characterization as fact rather than clearly identifying as Crux's opinion.

"Not only has there been what appears to be conspicuous editorial favouritism by the Mountain Scene in their support for the QLDC and mayor Lewers, but the Queenstown local paper has ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview while accepting over $200,000 in annual advertising payments from the QLDC each year." (lines 11-12) - This entire sentence presents Crux's opinions and unverified claims as factual findings without clear distinction.

The article oscillates between third-person reporting ("The Wanaka Chamber of Commerce has hired...") and first-person opinion ("We've suggested...") without clear demarcation of which parts are factual reporting and which are Crux's editorial perspective.

**Findings:**
The article breaches Principle 4 by failing to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion. What begins as apparent news reporting (announcement of debate moderator) becomes an opinion piece criticizing the choice, but without clear labeling to signal this shift. The serious allegations about bias and financial conflicts should have been clearly presented as Crux's opinions requiring verification rather than as established facts. The article should have been clearly labeled as an opinion piece or editorial commentary, with clearer distinction between verified facts (who the moderator is, when the debate is) and Crux's unverified allegations and opinions (that the moderator is biased, that Mountain Scene has ignored issues, that advertising creates conflicts).

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "Wanaka Chamber hires pro-Lewers editor for public debate"

**Accuracy Assessment:**
This headline presents as fact Crux's opinion that the editor is "pro-Lewers." While the article does contain this characterization, the headline states it as established fact rather than as an allegation or opinion requiring verification.

A more accurate headline would be:
- "Crux questions Wanaka Chamber's debate moderator choice"
- "Wanaka Chamber hires Mountain Scene editor for debate amid Crux concerns"
- "Crux lodges complaint over debate moderator selection"
- "Wanaka Chamber defends debate moderator choice" (if the Chamber had been given opportunity to respond)

**Misleading Elements:**
The headline misleads readers by:
1. Presenting opinion/characterization ("pro-Lewers") as fact
2. Suggesting an established, verified bias rather than an unproven allegation
3. Failing to signal that this is a controversy or complaint rather than straightforward news
4. Implying the moderator's bias is so clear it can be stated in the headline as fact

**Substance Reflection:**
The headline does reflect the key element of the article - that the Wanaka Chamber has hired a particular editor to moderate a debate. However, it fails to convey:
- That "pro-Lewers" is Crux's characterization, not established fact
- That this is about a complaint Crux has lodged, not about verified bias
- That those criticized were not given opportunity to respond
- That the allegations lack supporting evidence

The headline essentially convicts the editor of bias without trial, evidence, or right of reply.

**Evidence:**

Headline: "Wanaka Chamber hires pro-Lewers editor for public debate" (line 2)

The characterization "pro-Lewers" is stated as a factual descriptor of the editor, equivalent to stating their location (Queenstown) or their role (editor). This treats opinion as fact.

Compare to article content: "the Editor of the pro-Lewers, Queenstown based Mountain Scene" (line 7) - While the article provides this as Crux's characterization, it still presents it as fact rather than as an allegation requiring evidence.

A responsible headline would either attribute the characterization ("Crux calls editor 'pro-Lewers'") or avoid the characterization entirely while conveying the controversy ("Chamber debate moderator choice sparks complaint").

**Findings:**
The headline breaches Principle 6 by failing to accurately convey that the claim about the editor being "pro-Lewers" is Crux's unverified opinion rather than established fact. The headline gives readers the impression that the moderator's bias is so clear and proven it can be stated in the headline as a factual descriptor, when the content is actually an evidence-free allegation. The headline should have either attributed the characterization to Crux or focused on the fact of the complaint/controversy rather than stating the alleged bias as fact.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Crux's Own Conflicts:**
The article raises serious questions about Crux's own conflicts of interest in this matter:

**Coverage Impact:** Crux states "we are now having to review that decision" (line 17) regarding covering the September 16 debate. This suggests Crux may boycott or limit coverage of an important public electoral event because the Chamber did not choose a moderator Crux approves of. This raises questions:
- Is Crux using coverage as leverage to influence the Chamber's decisions?
- Is Crux's complaint motivated by journalistic standards or by desire to control the debate format?
- Does Crux have a financial or competitive interest in who moderates local debates?

**Competitive Context:** The article appears to position Crux as the arbiter of appropriate moderator selection and as the judge of other media outlets' bias. Given that Crux and Mountain Scene are both local media outlets covering the same council and election, there may be competitive dynamics at play. The article does not disclose:
- Whether Crux sought or wanted to moderate this debate
- Whether Crux has any competitive relationship with Mountain Scene
- Whether Peter Newport or other Crux staff have any personal conflicts with the Mountain Scene editor

**Own Bias:** The article demonstrates Crux's own strong editorial position regarding Mayor Lewers and QLDC, evidenced by:
- Describing issues as "sewage crisis" rather than wastewater management challenges (editorial characterization)
- Assuming that accepting government advertising inherently creates bias (an editorial position, not a universal journalistic standard)
- The complaint itself shows Crux has strong views about appropriate electoral coverage

If Crux is criticizing Mountain Scene for alleged bias toward Lewers, shouldn't Crux disclose its own editorial positions regarding Lewers and QLDC?

**Historical Pattern:** Given the documented history of NZMC complaints showing "serious breakdown in professional relationship" and "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" between Crux and QLDC entities (Case 2940), there is relevant context about Crux's own conflicts that should be disclosed.

**Disclosure Requirements:**
The article should disclose:
- Whether Crux sought to moderate this debate
- Any competitive relationship between Crux and Mountain Scene
- Crux's own editorial position on Lewers and QLDC
- The historical context of Crux's relationship with QLDC entities
- Whether the threat to limit debate coverage is intended as pressure on the Chamber

**Evidence:**

"Crux was planning to cover this September 16 event in Wanaka but we are now having to review that decision." (line 17) - This suggests using coverage as leverage, raising questions about Crux's motives in lodging the complaint.

"Crux has lodged a formal complaint with the Chamber Chair Jo Learmonth and General Manager Glenn Peat over this decision (main image above)." (line 9) - The article is essentially about Crux's own actions and complaints, but doesn't disclose what interests or motivations underlie those actions.

"We've suggested that a neutral Wanaka moderator would be more appropriate." (line 22) - This positions Crux as the arbiter of neutrality and appropriate moderator selection, but doesn't disclose Crux's own interests or biases.

**Findings:**
The article constitutes a potential breach of Principle 10 by failing to disclose Crux's own potential conflicts of interest in this matter. When a publication is essentially reporting on its own complaint and potentially using coverage decisions as leverage, readers deserve to know: what interests does Crux have in moderator selection? Does Crux have competitive or personal conflicts with Mountain Scene? What is Crux's own editorial position on the key figures and issues involved? The threat to reconsider covering an important public electoral event based on moderator selection raises particular concerns about using journalistic coverage as leverage for other objectives. At minimum, the article should have disclosed these potential conflicts to help readers evaluate Crux's motivations and credibility in making these allegations.

### Principle 1 (Additional Analysis): Specific Factual Claims Requiring Verification

**Analysis:**

Beyond the general lack of balance and fairness, specific factual claims in the article require verification:

**The "$200,000" Claim:**
The article states Mountain Scene accepts "over $200,000 in annual advertising payments from the QLDC each year" (line 11). This is a specific, verifiable factual claim that should be sourced:
- Is this from QLDC financial reports or budgets?
- Does it represent a single year or an average?
- Is this unusual compared to what QLDC spends with other media?
- Does this include statutory notices that must be published in local papers?

Making specific financial allegations without sourcing violates accuracy standards.

**The "Ignored" Claim:**
The allegation that Mountain Scene "ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview" (line 11) is verifiable but apparently unverified:
- Did Mountain Scene publish any articles on these issues?
- How does their coverage compare to Crux's coverage or other media?
- What constitutes "ignoring" vs. different editorial judgment about coverage emphasis?

This is presented as fact but appears to be Crux's opinion about coverage adequacy.

**The "Pro-Lewers" Claim:**
The characterization of Mountain Scene as "pro-Lewers" (line 7) should be supported by:
- Specific examples of favorable coverage
- Analysis of coverage patterns
- Comparison with coverage of other political figures
- Evidence of editorial decisions favoring Lewers

None of this evidence is provided.

**Evidence:**

The entire second paragraph (lines 11-12) consists of factual claims stated with certainty but provided without sources, verification, or supporting evidence.

**Findings:**
These specific factual claims demonstrate how the article's breach of Principle 1 (Accuracy) is not just about lack of balance but about making verifiable factual claims without verification. Responsible journalism requires either providing evidence for such claims or clearly labeling them as allegations requiring investigation.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**
The article is not clearly identified as opinion, column, or editorial content. It carries a standard byline ("by Peter Newport - Sep 13, 2025") suggesting news reporting. There is no label such as "Opinion," "Editorial," "Comment," or "Column" that would signal to readers this is not straight news reporting.

The use of first-person ("We've suggested," line 22, and "Crux has lodged," line 9) does signal this involves Crux's own actions and views, but this comes after factual claims and allegations are presented in third-person news format.

**Foundation of Fact:**
Even if treated as opinion content, the article has significant weaknesses in factual foundation:
- The allegation of bias is not supported by specific examples or analysis
- The $200,000 figure is not sourced or verified
- The claim of "ignoring" issues is not documented with coverage comparison
- The connection between advertising and bias is assumed rather than demonstrated

**Balance Requirement:**
Principle 5 notes "with comment and opinion balance is not essential." However, this protection applies to clearly-labeled opinion content "widely understood to consist largely of the writer's own opinions." This article occupies an ambiguous space - it reports news (moderator selection) while also expressing opinion (the selection is inappropriate) without clear labeling to distinguish the two functions.

If clearly labeled as an editorial or opinion column, the lack of balance might be acceptable. But presenting in news format without clear opinion labeling makes the one-sided nature problematic.

**Evidence:**

The article header shows: "by Peter Newport - Sep 13, 2025" (line 3) - standard news byline format, not opinion column identification.

No visual or textual indicators identify this as opinion, editorial, or column content rather than news reporting.

The mix of third-person news reporting ("The Wanaka Chamber of Commerce has hired...") and first-person opinion ("We've suggested...") creates genre confusion without clear labeling.

**Findings:**
If this article were clearly labeled as an opinion piece or editorial column, some of the balance concerns under Principle 1 might be mitigated, and the mixing of fact and opinion under Principle 4 would be more acceptable. However, because it presents in news format without clear identification as opinion content, it cannot claim the full protection of Principle 5. This constitutes a potential breach - the article should have been clearly labeled to help readers understand they are reading Crux's editorial perspective on a controversy Crux itself has initiated, not objective news reporting about that controversy.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise privacy concerns. The individuals named (Jo Learmonth, Glenn Peat) are public officials of the Chamber of Commerce engaged in organizing a public electoral debate. The unnamed Mountain Scene editor is identified only by professional role in connection with a public function (moderating a public debate). Mayor Lewers and QLDC are public entities. All matters discussed relate to public electoral processes and public debate organization, which are clearly matters of public interest.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical/mental disability. The criticism is directed at professional conduct and institutional decisions, not personal characteristics.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article does not appear to rely on confidential sources. All information is presented as Crux's own observations and complaints. No confidentiality issues arise.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text provided does not include photographs or graphics details for analysis (though line 9 references "main image above"). Cannot assess from available information.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The article makes serious allegations about media bias, professional misconduct, and potential corruption without providing supporting evidence and without giving fair opportunity for response to those criticized. Multiple parties (Mountain Scene, its editor, Wanaka Chamber officials, Mayor Lewers, QLDC) are accused of bias, favoritism, ignoring important issues, and financial conflicts of interest without right of reply. Specific factual claims ($200,000 in advertising, "ignoring" issues, "pro-Lewers" characterization) are stated without verification or sources.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The article fails to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion. Serious allegations and characterizations ("pro-Lewers," "conspicuous editorial favouritism," "ignored key issues") are presented as established facts rather than as Crux's unverified opinions. The article is not clearly labeled as opinion content despite functioning primarily as editorial commentary on Crux's own complaint.

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - BREACH**: The headline presents Crux's opinion ("pro-Lewers editor") as fact without attribution or qualification. The headline misleads readers about the nature of the content, suggesting verified bias rather than an unproven allegation that is the subject of a complaint.

4. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion or editorial content. It uses news format without clear labeling that would help readers understand they are reading Crux's editorial perspective on a controversy Crux initiated, rather than balanced reporting about that controversy.

5. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article fails to disclose Crux's own potential conflicts of interest when reporting on its own complaint and threatening to limit coverage of a public electoral debate. The article does not disclose competitive relationships, Crux's own editorial positions on the key figures involved, or whether Crux sought to moderate the debate itself.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This article demonstrates several patterns consistent with Crux's history of NZMC complaints:

1. **Fact/Opinion Confusion**: Like Cases 2891, 2895, and 2940, this article presents opinion and characterization as factual reporting without clear distinction or labeling.

2. **Inadequate Right of Reply**: Like Cases 2891, 2940, and 3356, this article makes serious allegations about parties without giving them opportunity to respond before publication.

3. **Unverified Claims**: Like previous cases, the article makes specific factual claims (financial figures, characterizations of coverage patterns) without providing sources or verification.

4. **Inaccurate Headlines**: Like Cases 2940 and 3356, the headline states opinion/allegation as fact.

5. **Antagonistic Relationship**: The article continues the pattern noted in Case 2940 of "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" with QLDC entities, now extended to include other local media and community organizations.

If this pattern extends to other recent Crux coverage, it suggests the publication has not addressed the concerns raised in previous NZMC rulings about maintaining ethical journalism standards while pursuing advocacy journalism.

---

**Electoral Context:**

This article's publication during an election period has several critical implications:

1. **Electoral Integrity**: By making unverified allegations about bias in electoral debate moderation, the article could influence public perception and the Chamber's decision-making without allowing those criticized adequate opportunity to respond. The debate is scheduled for just three days after publication (September 16), limiting time for response.

2. **Public Interest Impact**: The article may discourage community organizations from hosting electoral debates if they fear being publicly accused of bias without evidence. This could reduce democratic discourse opportunities.

3. **Coverage Leverage**: Crux's threat to reconsider covering the debate raises concerns about using journalistic coverage as leverage to influence debate organization, rather than serving the public interest in covering important electoral events regardless of format preferences.

4. **Voter Information**: Voters deserve balanced information about the allegations made. Without responses from the Chamber, Mountain Scene, or others criticized, voters cannot evaluate the validity of the claims or make informed judgments about the debate's credibility.

5. **Media Competition**: During an election period, allegations of bias against competing media outlets have particular significance. If the allegations are unfounded, they unfairly damage a competitor's reputation at a critical time for electoral journalism.

The electoral timing transforms this from a simple media criticism piece into a potentially significant interference with democratic electoral processes, making the lack of evidence and right of reply particularly problematic.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are strong grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC by affected parties, citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The article fails to give fair voice to those criticized and makes factual claims without verification. Specific grounds:
   - No right of reply given to Mountain Scene or its editor regarding allegations of bias, favoritism, and conflicts of interest
   - No opportunity for Wanaka Chamber officials to explain moderator selection criteria or defend their choice
   - No response from Mayor Lewers regarding implications of media bias toward him
   - No response from QLDC regarding allegations of using advertising to influence coverage
   - Specific factual claims (over $200,000 in advertising, "ignoring" sewage and Lakeview issues) stated without sources or verification
   - Characterization of editor as "pro-Lewers" stated without supporting evidence

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The article fails to clearly distinguish between factual information and opinion. Specific grounds:
   - Serious allegations presented as facts rather than opinions requiring verification
   - Article not clearly labeled as opinion or editorial despite functioning as such
   - Mix of third-person news reporting and first-person opinion without clear demarcation

3. **Principle 6 - Headlines and Captions**: The headline presents opinion as fact. Specific grounds:
   - Headline states "pro-Lewers editor" as factual descriptor without attribution
   - Misleads readers about content being about verified bias rather than unproven allegation
   - Fails to signal this is about a complaint Crux has lodged

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 5 - Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion content despite functioning primarily as editorial commentary.

5. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: The article fails to disclose Crux's own potential conflicts of interest when reporting on its own complaint and potentially using coverage as leverage.

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Lack of Balance - Allegations Without Right of Reply:**
   - "The Wanaka Chamber of Commerce has hired the Editor of the pro-Lewers, Queenstown based Mountain Scene community newspaper" (line 7) - Serious allegation of bias without evidence or right of reply

   - Mountain Scene "ignored key issues such as the sewage crisis and Lakeview while accepting over $200,000 in annual advertising payments from the QLDC each year" (lines 11-12) - Implies quid pro quo corruption without evidence or right of reply
   - "Crux has lodged a formal complaint with the Chamber Chair Jo Learmonth and General Manager Glenn Peat" (line 9) - Chamber officials publicly criticized without opportunity to explain their decision

2. **Opinion Presented as Fact:**

   - No label identifying content as "Opinion," "Editorial," or "Column"
   - Mix of third-person reporting and first-person opinion creates genre confusion

5. **Conflict of Interest Disclosure Failure:**
   - "We are now having to review that decision" (line 17) regarding covering the debate - Using coverage as potential leverage without disclosing Crux's interests
   - Reporting on Crux's own complaint without disclosing Crux's relationships, competitive interests, or own editorial positions

---

**Who Has Standing to Complain:**

Multiple parties have standing to bring this complaint:

1. **Mountain Scene and/or its editor** - Directly accused of bias, favoritism, and conflicts of interest affecting professional reputation
2. **Wanaka Chamber of Commerce** (via Jo Learmonth or Glenn Peat) - Decision-making criticized and judgment questioned
3. **Mayor Glyn Lewers** - Implicated in allegations of media bias and improper influence
4. **QLDC** - Accused of using advertising to influence media coverage
5. **Community members** concerned about fair electoral journalism and debate integrity

Given that multiple parties are criticized, a joint complaint or multiple coordinated complaints might be appropriate.

- **Content**: Should cite specific principle breaches and request:
  - Publication of full responses from all parties criticized
  - Correction acknowledging allegations were not verified before publication
  - Retraction of unverified factual claims (or publication of supporting evidence)
  - Correction to headline to properly attribute "pro-Lewers" as opinion rather than fact
  - Disclosure of Crux's own conflicts of interest in this matter
  - Clear labeling if article is republished as opinion/editorial rather than news

**Step 2 - Escalation to NZMC (if necessary):**
- **Timing**: If no response within 10 working days, or if response is unsatisfactory
- **Deadline**: Within 20 working days of publisher's response (or non-response)
- **Method**: Online complaint form at NZMC website

  - Provide article link and copy
  - Include initial complaint to publisher and their response
  - Provide key points in 500 words

  - Sign waiver (no other formal action regarding same article)

**Step 3 - Supporting Documentation to Gather:**
- Copy of article as published (screenshot and text)
- Evidence of Mountain Scene's actual coverage of sewage and Lakeview issues (to rebut "ignored" claim)
- QLDC advertising budget information showing payments to various media outlets (for context on the $200,000 claim)
- Evidence of moderator's qualifications and any history of debate moderation
- Documentation of how the Chamber selected the moderator
- Any other Crux articles showing pattern of allegations without verification
- Evidence of whether Crux sought to moderate the debate

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of the decision with fair prominence in the section where original article ran

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for:
   - Mountain Scene and/or its editor
   - Wanaka Chamber of Commerce officials
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers
   - QLDC

   To be given fair prominence similar to original article

4. **Correction/Retraction**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Allegations of bias were not supported by evidence or verified before publication
   - Parties criticized were not given opportunity to respond
   - Specific factual claims should have been sourced or labeled as allegations
   - "Pro-Lewers" is Crux's characterization, not established fact
   - Article should have been labeled as opinion/editorial
   - Crux's own conflicts of interest should have been disclosed

5. **Evidence Publication**: Request that if Crux maintains its allegations are factual, it must publish the supporting evidence:
   - Specific examples of "pro-Lewers" coverage by Mountain Scene
   - Documentation of the $200,000+ in advertising
   - Evidence that Mountain Scene "ignored" sewage and Lakeview issues
   - Analysis supporting claim of "conspicuous editorial favouritism"

6. **Process Improvements**: Request Crux establish clear editorial policies for:
   - Verification of factual claims before publication
   - Mandatory right of reply when individuals/organizations are criticized
   - Clear labeling of opinion vs. news content
   - Disclosure of conflicts of interest, particularly when reporting on Crux's own actions
   - Application of same standards Crux demands of others to Crux's own journalism

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Timing is Critical**: The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher is October 13, 2025 - prompt action recommended.

2. **Public Interest**: This complaint serves public interest by:
   - Protecting reputations from unfounded allegations
   - Ensuring electoral debates can be organized without fear of unsubstantiated attacks
   - Holding Crux to the same standards it demands of others
   - Establishing that allegations of bias require evidence, not just assertion
   - Protecting democratic processes from interference based on unverified claims

3. **Coordination**: Given multiple affected parties, consider whether a coordinated response or joint complaint would be more effective than individual complaints.

4. **Pattern Evidence**: This complaint gains strength from Crux's history of similar breaches (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356) involving failure to distinguish fact from opinion and inadequate right of reply. NZMC may view this as continuing a pattern rather than an isolated incident.

5. **Electoral Impact**: Document any actual impact:
   - Did the Chamber change moderator selection in response to Crux's complaint?
   - Did the article affect public perception of the debate's credibility?
   - Did it influence voter views of the candidates or issues?
   - Did it affect Mountain Scene's reputation or business?

6. **Precedent Value**: This complaint could establish important precedents:
   - That allegations of media bias require evidence, not just assertion
   - That publications cannot use coverage as leverage without disclosure
   - That "advocacy journalism" does not exempt publications from basic verification and fairness standards
   - That publications must disclose their own conflicts when reporting on their own complaints

7. **Broader Reform**: Given Crux's pattern of breaches despite previous NZMC rulings, this complaint might prompt consideration of:
   - Whether more substantial remedies are needed for repeat offenders
   - Whether NZMC should require publications to demonstrate how they've implemented previous rulings
   - Whether patterns of breaches warrant different responses than isolated incidents

**Conclusion:**

This article represents a significant failure of journalistic standards, particularly given the electoral context and Crux's history of similar breaches. The combination of unverified allegations, failure to distinguish fact from opinion, misleading headline, denial of right of reply to multiple criticized parties, and failure to disclose Crux's own conflicts of interest constitutes multiple breaches of NZMC principles.

The article's primary function appears to be attacking a competitor publication and pressuring a community organization to change its debate moderator selection, rather than informing readers through balanced journalism. The serious allegations of bias, favoritism, and corruption are made without evidence and without giving those accused any opportunity to respond.

Most concerning is that this article demonstrates Crux has not addressed the fundamental issues raised in multiple previous NZMC rulings: distinguishing fact from opinion, providing adequate right of reply, verifying claims before publication, and maintaining professional standards even when pursuing advocacy journalism.

A formal complaint is warranted and should be pursued by affected parties within the one-month deadline. The complaint serves not only to address this specific article but to establish that publications cannot make serious allegations without evidence, cannot report on their own complaints without disclosing conflicts, and cannot use coverage decisions as leverage without transparency about their interests and motivations.

Given Crux's pattern of similar breaches across five previous NZMC cases (60% upheld), this complaint may prompt consideration of whether more substantial remedies are needed to ensure compliance with ethical journalism standards.
