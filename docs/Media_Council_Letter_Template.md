# Letter to NZ Media Council - Non-Compliance Report

**DRAFT TEMPLATE - CUSTOMIZE AS NEEDED**

---

**To:** New Zealand Media Council  
**Email:** info@mediacouncil.org.nz  
**Date:** [Insert Date]  
**Subject:** Non-Compliance with Media Council Ruling - Case 2940

---

Dear Media Council,

I am writing to report apparent non-compliance by Crux Publishing with your ruling in **Case 2940: Queenstown Airport Corporation Against Crux** (September 2020).

## Summary of Issue

The Media Council upheld complaints under Principles 1, 4, and 6, specifically ruling that the headline "Airport risks bank limits over redundant $200 million land purchase" was inaccurate because:

> "Its redundancy is not a fact and nor is the $200m price stated in the headline... Because of its unsupported contentions that the land is no longer needed or redundant Crux is in breach of Media Council Principle 1 (accuracy, fairness and balance) and Principle 6 (headlines and captions)." (Paragraph 54)

## Current Status (October 2025)

**Five years after your ruling**, the article remains online with the **SAME INACCURATE HEADLINE**:

- **Article URL:** https://crux.org.nz/crux-news/airport-risks-bank-limits-over-redundant-200-million-land-purchase
- **Current headline:** "Airport risks bank limits over **redundant** $200 million land purchase"
- **Breach notice:** Present (acknowledges the ruling)
- **Headline correction:** **NOT MADE**

## Specific Non-Compliance

While Crux has added a breach notice stating:
> "This article has been found to breach Media Council Principles of Accuracy, Fairness, Comment and Fact, and Headlines and captions. The full Media Council ruling is at www.mediacouncil.org.nz"

**The specific correction required by your ruling has NOT been made.** The word "redundant" remains in the headline, perpetuating the inaccuracy you identified.

## Additional Concerns

### 1. Missing Articles
Your ruling covered THREE articles, but only one can be located:
- ✅ "Airport risks bank limits over redundant $200 million land purchase" (19 June 2020) - FOUND
- ❌ "Into the Danger Zone – is something Very Bad about to happen with our airports?" (2 May 2020) - NOT FOUND
- ❌ "Will the Bank of China need to rescue Queenstown Airport's debts?" (7 July 2020) - NOT FOUND

**Question:** Should these articles also have breach notices? If they have been deleted, does this comply with your "enduring electronic copy" requirement?

### 2. Case 3356 - Deletion of Original Article
In **Case 3356: Andrew Tipene Against Crux Publishing** (December 2022), the original article has been completely deleted. Crux published a correction article, but the original "enduring electronic copy" no longer exists.

**Question:** Does deletion of the original article comply with your requirement that "All enduring electronic copy that the Council has ruled to be in breach of its Principles must carry a note at the top of the copy that it has been found in breach and why"?

## Questions for the Media Council

1. **Has Crux's compliance been verified?**
   - Is there a follow-up process to ensure corrections are made?
   - Who is responsible for verifying compliance?

2. **What are the consequences for non-compliance?**
   - What happens when a publisher acknowledges a ruling but doesn't make the required corrections?
   - Are there any enforcement mechanisms?

3. **Is deletion of original articles acceptable?**
   - Case 3356: Original deleted, correction published
   - Case 2940: Two articles appear to be missing
   - Does this comply with the "enduring electronic copy" requirement?

4. **What should be done about the Case 2940 headline?**
   - Should the word "redundant" be removed immediately?
   - Can the Media Council require this correction to be made?

## Why This Matters

This is not just about one word in one headline. It demonstrates a pattern where:

1. **Crux acknowledges breaches** (adds breach notices)
2. **But doesn't fully correct them** (headline remains inaccurate)
3. **Articles may be deleted** (removing the "enduring electronic copy")
4. **Pattern persists over years** (5 years and still not corrected)

This undermines the effectiveness of the Media Council process. If publishers can acknowledge rulings without making the required corrections, what is the point of the ruling?

## Request for Action

I respectfully request that the Media Council:

1. **Verify compliance** with all three upheld complaints against Crux (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356)
2. **Contact Crux** to require immediate correction of the Case 2940 headline
3. **Clarify policy** on deletion of original articles
4. **Provide guidance** on what constitutes acceptable compliance
5. **Consider enforcement** if Crux continues to not make required corrections

## Supporting Documentation

I have conducted a detailed investigation and can provide:
- Screenshots of current article states
- Full compliance report analyzing all three cases
- Comparison of breach notices vs. actual corrections made
- Evidence of missing articles

These documents are available upon request.

## Background Context

I am documenting Crux's compliance with Media Council rulings as part of a broader project examining media accountability. I have identified multiple upheld complaints against Crux over several years, and I am concerned about the pattern of non-compliance with your rulings.

Your guidance on these matters would be greatly appreciated.

## NOTES FOR CUSTOMIZATION

**Before sending:**
1. Add your name and contact information
2. Decide if you want to attach the full reports or just reference them
3. Consider your tone - this template is formal and factual
4. Decide if you want to mention your broader complaint project
5. Consider whether to send this before or after contacting Crux directly

**Alternative approaches:**
1. **Softer approach:** Frame as "seeking clarification" rather than "reporting non-compliance"
2. **Stronger approach:** Explicitly request enforcement action
3. **Collaborative approach:** Offer to work with Media Council to improve compliance processes

**Timing considerations:**
1. Send now to establish the record
2. Wait to see if Crux makes corrections after your website goes live
3. Send as part of a broader complaint about ongoing breaches

**Follow-up:**
- If no response in 2 weeks, send a polite follow-up
- If Media Council confirms non-compliance, document their response
- If Media Council says deletion is acceptable, update your understanding
- Use their response in your broader complaint documentation
