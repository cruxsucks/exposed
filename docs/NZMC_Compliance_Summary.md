## üö® CRITICAL FINDING: NON-COMPLIANCE IDENTIFIED

### Case 2940: Headline Correction NOT Made

**Media Council Ruling (September 2020):**
> "Its redundancy is not a fact... Because of its unsupported contentions that the land is no longer needed or redundant Crux is in breach of Media Council Principle 1 (accuracy, fairness and balance) and Principle 6 (headlines and captions)."

**Current Status (October 2025):**
- ‚ùå Headline STILL contains "redundant": "Airport risks bank limits over redundant $200 million land purchase"
- ‚úÖ Breach notice added to article
- ‚ùå Specific correction NOT made

**This is a direct violation of the Media Council's ruling.**

## What the Media Council Requires

When a complaint is upheld, publishers MUST:

1. ‚úÖ **Publish Media Council summary** - unedited, with fair prominence
2. ‚úÖ **Add breach notice to article** - stating which principles were breached
3. ‚úÖ **Link to full ruling** - on Media Council website
4. ‚ùå **CORRECT THE INACCURACIES** - this is the critical missing piece
5. ‚ùì **Keep "enduring electronic copy"** - with breach notice at top

---

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What Crux Did Right:
- Added breach notices to articles 2891 and 2940
- Published comprehensive correction article for case 3356
- Linked to Media Council website
- Gave corrections fair prominence

### ‚ùå What Crux Failed To Do:
1. **Case 2940:** Did NOT correct the headline (still says "redundant")
2. **Case 2940:** Two articles appear to be deleted without breach notices
3. **Case 3356:** Deleted original article (questionable compliance)
4. **All cases:** Links go to Media Council homepage, not specific rulings

---

## Required Actions

### IMMEDIATE (Case 2940):
1. **Remove "redundant" from headline** - This is not optional
2. **Locate missing articles:**
   - "Into the Danger Zone ‚Äì is something Very Bad about to happen with our airports?" (2 May 2020)
   - "Will the Bank of China need to rescue Queenstown Airport's debts?" (7 July 2020)
3. **Add breach notices** to those articles OR explain why they were deleted

### RECOMMENDED:
4. Update all links to point to specific Media Council rulings
5. Clarify with Media Council whether deletion of original articles is acceptable
6. Check social media posts for breach notices

---

## The "Redundant" Problem

**Why this matters:**

The Media Council specifically ruled that calling the land purchase "redundant" was:
- ‚ùå Not a fact
- ‚ùå Unsupported
- ‚ùå A breach of accuracy principles
- ‚ùå A breach of headline principles

**Yet 5 years later, the headline still says "redundant".**

This means:
- The breach notice acknowledges the ruling
- But the article itself perpetuates the inaccuracy
- Readers see the inaccurate headline first
- The correction is incomplete

**This undermines the entire Media Council process.**

---

## Questions for the Media Council

1. **Has Crux's compliance been verified?**
   - Did the Media Council check that corrections were made?
   - Is there a follow-up process?

2. **Is deletion of original articles acceptable?**
   - Case 3356: Original article deleted, correction published
   - Does this comply with "enduring electronic copy" requirement?

3. **What happens if corrections are not made?**
   - Case 2940: Headline still inaccurate after 5 years
   - Are there consequences for non-compliance?

---

## Recommendations

### For the User:
1. **Document this non-compliance** - Screenshots, archived versions
2. **Contact Media Council** - Report that Case 2940 headline has not been corrected
3. **Consider formal complaint** - About non-compliance with ruling
4. **Use in your complaint** - This demonstrates a pattern of non-compliance

### For Crux:
1. **Correct the headline immediately** - Remove "redundant"
2. **Locate missing articles** - Add breach notices or explain deletion
3. **Update links** - Point to specific rulings
4. **Demonstrate good faith** - Show willingness to comply fully

---

## Context: Why This Matters

Your goal is to document Crux's pattern of breaches. This compliance investigation shows:

1. **Crux acknowledges breaches** (adds breach notices)
2. **But doesn't fully correct them** (headline still wrong)
3. **Articles may be deleted** (2 missing from Case 2940, 1 from Case 3356)
4. **Pattern over 5 years** (2020-2025)

This strengthens your case that Crux has ongoing issues with:
- Accuracy (P1)
- Headlines (P6)
- Corrections (P12)
- Accountability

---

**Bottom Line:**

Crux has made **partial efforts** to comply with Media Council rulings by adding breach notices, but has **FAILED to make the specific corrections required**, particularly the headline in Case 2940. This is not acceptable compliance.

The word "redundant" should have been removed from the headline 5 years ago. It's still there today.
