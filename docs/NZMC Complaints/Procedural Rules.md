# Media Council Compliance Status
## Procedural Requirements for Upheld Complaints

## Why Procedural Compliance Matters

When the New Zealand Media Council upholds a complaint, it has found that a publication breached its Principles - standards that protect the public from inaccurate, unfair, or misleading journalism. The procedural requirements that follow an upheld ruling are not merely administrative formalities; they serve critical functions:

### 1. **Correcting the Public Record**
Inaccurate information, once published, can spread widely and persist indefinitely online. Corrections ensure that readers who saw the original inaccurate article can also see that it was found to be wrong. This is fundamental to maintaining an informed public.

### 2. **Accountability and Transparency**
Breach notices demonstrate that the publisher acknowledges the Media Council's authority and accepts responsibility for breaches. Without visible corrections, there is no public accountability for inaccurate journalism.

### 3. **Deterring Future Breaches**
When publishers know they must publicly acknowledge breaches, it creates an incentive for higher editorial standards. Conversely, failure to comply undermines the entire self-regulatory system.

### 4. **Protecting Those Harmed**
Inaccurate articles can damage reputations, mislead communities, and cause real harm. Corrections provide some remedy to those affected by acknowledging the inaccuracy publicly.

### 5. **Maintaining Trust in Media**
The Media Council system only works if publishers comply with rulings. When publishers ignore or partially comply with rulings, it erodes public trust in both the publisher and the self-regulatory system.

**The fair prominence requirements exist to ensure corrections reach the same audience as the original inaccurate article.** A correction buried on a back page or missing from social media fails this fundamental purpose.

## Why Fair Prominence and Corrections Matter

When the Media Council upholds a complaint, it has determined that a publication has breached its fundamental principles of journalism - accuracy, fairness, balance, or proper distinction between fact and comment. These are not minor technical violations; they represent failures that can:

- **Mislead the public** on matters of significant public interest
- **Damage reputations** of individuals and organizations through inaccurate reporting
- **Undermine public trust** in media and democratic institutions
- **Perpetuate false narratives** that continue to harm long after initial publication

The fair prominence requirements exist to ensure that:

1. **Corrections reach the same audience** as the original inaccurate article
2. **The public record is corrected** - enduring copies must carry breach notices
3. **Publishers take accountability** for breaches of professional standards
4. **Future readers are warned** that content has been found inaccurate or unfair

**Without proper compliance, the Media Council process becomes meaningless.** If publishers can acknowledge rulings but fail to make required corrections, they continue to benefit from inaccurate content while paying only lip service to accountability.

### The Importance of Specific Corrections

It is not sufficient to simply add a generic breach notice. When the Media Council rules that specific content is inaccurate (such as the word "redundant" in Case 2940), that specific content must be corrected. A breach notice that says "this article was found inaccurate" while leaving the inaccuracy in place does not serve the public interest and does not constitute genuine compliance.

## Social Media Compliance Requirements

### Media Council Requirement

According to the NZ Media Council's Complaints Procedure:

> **"Where an article the Council has ruled inaccurate has been further published on a publication's website or social media platforms, the publisher must add a note at the top of the copy to say it has been found to be in breach and why, with a link to the Council's full ruling."**

### Application to Crux Publishing

All three upheld complaints against Crux (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356) involved articles that were published or promoted on Crux's Facebook page. Under the Media Council's procedural rules, Crux is **required** to add breach notices to these Facebook posts.

### The Problem: Verification is Difficult

Facebook's search functionality makes it extremely difficult for third parties to:
- Locate specific historical posts
- Verify whether breach notices have been added
- Confirm compliance with Media Council rulings

**This difficulty cannot excuse non-compliance.** The burden of proof must rest with the publisher, not the complainant.

### Required Action: Crux Must Prove Compliance

Given:
1. **Established pattern of non-compliance** (Case 2940 headline still incorrect after 5 years)
2. **Missing articles** (2 articles from Case 2940 cannot be located)
3. **Difficulty of verification** (Facebook posts are hard to search)
4. **Publisher's responsibility** (Crux controls access to its Facebook content)

**Crux Publishing must provide evidence that it has complied with social media breach notice requirements for all three upheld complaints:**

| Case | Requirement | Evidence Required from Crux |
|------|-------------|----------------------------|
| **2891** | Breach notices on Facebook posts about "Wide body jets" article | Screenshots or links to Facebook posts showing breach notices added |
| **2940** | Breach notices on Facebook posts about all three airport articles | Screenshots or links to Facebook posts showing breach notices added |
| **3356** | Breach notices on Facebook posts about "QLDC engineer" article | Screenshots or links to Facebook posts showing breach notices added OR confirmation posts were deleted |

### Questions for Crux Publishing

1. **Did you publish or promote any of the three upheld complaint articles on Facebook?**
   - If YES: Provide evidence of breach notices added to those posts
   - If NO: Provide explanation of your social media policy

2. **Have you added breach notices to all Facebook posts relating to upheld complaints?**
   - If YES: Provide screenshots or links as evidence
   - If NO: Explain why not and when you will comply

3. **If Facebook posts were deleted, when and why were they deleted?**
   - Deletion may violate the "enduring electronic copy" requirement
   - Provide explanation and timeline

### Why This Matters

The Media Council's social media requirement recognizes that **articles shared on Facebook often reach larger audiences than the original website article**. Failing to add breach notices to Facebook posts means:

- ‚ùå The correction doesn't reach the same audience as the original inaccuracy
- ‚ùå The "fair prominence" requirement is violated
- ‚ùå Misinformation continues to circulate uncorrected
- ‚ùå The Media Council's ruling is rendered ineffective

**Crux cannot claim compliance with Media Council rulings without demonstrating compliance with social media breach notice requirements.**
