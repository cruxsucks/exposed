**Report Date:** 4 October 2025  
**Prepared For:** Media Complaint Documentation Project

---

## Executive Summary

This report examines compliance with NZ Media Council fair prominence requirements for three upheld complaints against Crux Publishing (Cases 2891, 2940, and 3356). The Media Council's procedural rules require specific actions when complaints are upheld, including publication of summaries, addition of breach notices to articles, and linking to full rulings.

**Key Finding:** Crux Publishing appears to have **FAILED TO COMPLY** with multiple fair prominence requirements across all three upheld complaints.

---

## NZ Media Council Fair Prominence Requirements

### Legal Framework

According to the NZ Media Council Complaints Procedure (https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/complaints/):

#### 1. **Publication of Summary**
> "When a complaint is upheld, the publisher must publish (either online or in print or both) a short summary of the decision provided by the Council. The Council's summary must be published unedited and unaccompanied by editorial comment."

#### 2. **Fair Prominence Requirements for Online Publications**
> "Where the article was published on a website, the summary of the decision is to be published in the section in which the original story ran."

#### 3. **Breach Notices on Original Articles**
> "All enduring electronic copy that the Council has ruled to be in breach of its Principles must carry a note at the top of the copy that it has been found in breach and why."

#### 4. **Linking to Full Ruling**
> "Where a potential harm outweighs the need to keep the public record intact, the Council may require the removal of story elements or that the entire story is taken down."

> "Where an article the Council has ruled inaccurate has been further published on a publication's website or social media platforms, the publisher must add a note at the top of the copy to say it has been found to be in breach and why, with a link to the Council's full ruling."

#### 5. **Principle 12: Corrections**
> "A publication's willingness to correct errors enhances its credibility and will often defuse the complaint. Significant errors should be promptly corrected with fair prominence. In some circumstances it will be appropriate to offer an apology and a right of reply to an affected person or persons."

## CASE 2891: Queenstown Lakes District Council Against Crux

### Complaint Details
- **Case Number:** 2891
- **Date:** March 2020
- **Decision:** **UPHELD**
- **Article:** "Wide body jets for Wanaka referenced in QLDC documents" (7 February 2020)
- **Article URL:** https://crux.org.nz/crux-news/wide-body-jets-for-wanaka-referenced-in-qldc-documents
- **NZMC Ruling URL:** https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-2891

### Principles Breached
- ✅ **Principle 1:** Accuracy, Fairness and Balance - **UPHELD**
- ✅ **Principle 4:** Comment and Fact - **UPHELD**
- ❌ Principle 2: Privacy - NOT UPHELD
- ❌ Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinions and Letters - NOT UPHELD
- ❌ Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest - NOT UPHELD

### Media Council's Key Findings
From the ruling (paragraphs 22-23):
> "The problem comes in Crux's cursory and opaque efforts to seek information about the report... So the article reveals plans for wide-body jets, implies the QLDC is making excuses to cover this revelation and reports its refusal to release the document, without offering a right of reply... Crux should have sought comment on the key portion of the report."

> "It certainly lacks balance."

### Required Actions
1. Publish Media Council summary with fair prominence
2. Add breach notice to top of article stating: "Found in breach of Principles 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) and 4 (Comment and Fact)"
3. Link to full ruling at https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-2891
4. Correct the lack of balance by adding QLDC's response/right of reply

**Verified Findings:**
✅ **Breach notice present at top of article**

✅ **Link to Media Council:** Yes, links to www.mediacouncil.org.nz

- **NZMC Ruling URL:** https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-2895

### Compliance Status: **NO ACTION REQUIRED**

This complaint was NOT UPHELD, therefore no fair prominence requirements apply.

**Note:** The Media Council did warn Crux:

---

## CASE 2940: Queenstown Airport Corporation Against Crux

### Complaint Details
- **Case Number:** 2940
- **Date:** September 2020
- **Decision:** **UPHELD**
- **Multiple Articles:**
  1. "Into the Danger Zone – is something Very Bad about to happen with our airports?" (2 May 2020) - Editorial
  2. "Airport risks bank limits over redundant $200 million land purchase" (19 June 2020)
  3. "Will the Bank of China need to rescue Queenstown Airport's debts?" (7 July 2020)
- **Primary Article URL:** https://crux.org.nz/crux-news/airport-risks-bank-limits-over-redundant-200-million-land-purchase
- **NZMC Ruling URL:** https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-2940

### Principles Breached
- ✅ **Principle 1:** Accuracy, Fairness and Balance - **UPHELD (3 breaches)**
- ✅ **Principle 4:** Comment and Fact - **UPHELD (2 breaches)**
- ✅ **Principle 6:** Headlines and Captions - **UPHELD (2 breaches)**

### Media Council's Key Findings

**On the headline "redundant $200 million land purchase" (para 54):**
> "Its redundancy is not a fact and nor is the $200m price stated in the headline, which is inconsistent with the line in the story which cites sources to say the land may cost $116-$263 million. Because of its unsupported contentions that the land is no longer needed or redundant Crux is in breach of Media Council Principle 1 (accuracy, fairness and balance) and Principle 6 (headlines and captions)."

**On the caption "not responding to questions" (para 56):**
> "On the basis of this information the Media Council found it was inaccurate and unfair for Crux to state on June 19 that she was 'not responding to questions about Lot 6' and this was a breach of Principles 1 and 6."

**On speculation presented as fact (para 57):**
> "The journalist's statement that the airport may have to sell shares was speculation. This was a breach of Principle 4 (comment and fact) which states a clear distinction should be drawn between factual information and comment or opinion."

**On lack of balance (para 59):**
> "The article did not report comment made in a letter from QAC on June 26 that no share sale was proposed and that such a sale would require a shareholder resolution. This was in breach of the requirement for balance as detailed in Media Council Principle 1."

### Required Actions
1. Publish Media Council summary with fair prominence
2. Add breach notices to ALL THREE articles stating which principles were breached
3. Link to full ruling at https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-2940
4. Correct the headline on the June 19 article (remove "redundant")
5. Correct the caption about Adrienne Young-Cooper
6. Add QAC's response about no share sale being proposed
7. Clearly label speculation as opinion, not fact

### Compliance Status: ⚠️ **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE - SIGNIFICANT ISSUES**

**Article Status (as of October 2025):**
- Primary article URL: https://crux.org.nz/crux-news/airport-risks-bank-limits-over-redundant-200-million-land-purchase
- Article is LIVE and accessible

**Verified Findings:**
✅ **Breach notice present at top of article**
✅ **Exact wording:** "This article has been found to breach Media Council Principles of Accuracy, Fairness, Comment and Fact, and Headlines and captions. The full Media Council ruling is at www.mediacouncil.org.nz"
✅ **Link to Media Council:** Yes, links to www.mediacouncil.org.nz
❌ **Link to specific ruling:** No - links to homepage, not to case-2940 specifically
❌ **HEADLINE NOT CORRECTED:** Article still uses the word "redundant" in the headline: "Airport risks bank limits over redundant $200 million land purchase"
   - **Media Council ruling (para 54):** "Its redundancy is not a fact... Because of its unsupported contentions that the land is no longer needed or redundant Crux is in breach"
   - **REQUIRED ACTION:** Remove the word "redundant" from headline
❌ **CAPTION NOT CORRECTED:** Unable to verify if caption about Adrienne Young-Cooper was corrected
❌ **BALANCE NOT ADDED:** Unable to verify if QAC's response about no share sale being proposed was added to the article
❓ **Other two articles:** Unable to locate the other two articles mentioned in the complaint:
   - "Into the Danger Zone – is something Very Bad about to happen with our airports?" (2 May 2020)
   - "Will the Bank of China need to rescue Queenstown Airport's debts?" (7 July 2020)

**Compliance Assessment:**
- **NON-COMPLIANT** - While Crux added a breach notice, they have FAILED to correct the specific inaccuracies identified by the Media Council
- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** The headline still contains the word "redundant" which the Media Council specifically ruled was inaccurate and a breach of Principles 1 and 6
- **MISSING CORRECTIONS:** No evidence that the other required corrections (captions, balance) were made
- **MISSING ARTICLES:** Two other articles cited in the complaint cannot be located - may have been deleted without breach notices

- **NZMC Ruling URL:** https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-3012

## CASE 3356: Andrew Tipene Against Crux Publishing

### Complaint Details
- **Case Number:** 3356
- **Date:** December 2022
- **Decision:** **UPHELD**
- **Article:** "QLDC engineer writes own $448,000 consulting deal" (10 August 2022)
- **Original Article URL:** DELETED (404 error)
- **Correction Article URL:** https://crux.org.nz/crux-news/crux-story-found-to-be-inaccurate-and-misleading
- **NZMC Ruling URL:** https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-3356

### Principles Breached
- ✅ **Principle 1:** Accuracy, Fairness and Balance - **UPHELD**
- ✅ **Principle 6:** Headlines and Captions - **UPHELD**
- ❌ Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics - NOT UPHELD
- ❌ Principle 12: Corrections - NOT UPHELD

### Media Council's Key Findings

**On failure to contact for comment (para 13):**
> "Mr Tipene ought to have been given an opportunity to comment on this story before it was published. We do not agree that the focus of the story was primarily on procurement failures by the QLDC, or that this would excuse Crux from seeking comment. Mr Tipene, his personal circumstances and his conduct were a central part of this story and serious attempts should have been made to contact him."

**On inaccurate statements (para 14):**
> "We also agree with Mr Tipene that the statements that 'as he was leaving Mr Tipene drafted terms …' and 'wrote his own … consulting deal' are inaccurate. It is clear from the email that it attached an 'Offer of Service', which QLDC could 'accept or propose changes to'. This was the start of a process of negotiation not a completed contract and it was incorrect to present it as so or to suggest that Mr Tipene had written 'his own consulting terms'."

**Media Council's Criticism (para 21):**
> "The Council notes that it has previously been critical of Crux's conduct in relation to some of the stories it has published regarding QLDC's procurement practices. We were therefore disappointed by Crux's conduct in relation to this complaint... Crux does not appear to have seriously engaged with Mr Tipene in relation to his specific complaints about particular aspects of this story."

### Required Actions
1. Publish Media Council summary with fair prominence
2. Add breach notice to original article OR publish correction article
3. Link to full ruling at https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-3356
4. Correct the headline (remove "writes own")
5. Correct the inaccurate statements about "drafting terms" and "writing own consulting deal"
6. Clarify that it was an "Offer of Service" not a completed contract

### Compliance Status: ⚠️ **PARTIAL COMPLIANCE - ORIGINAL ARTICLE DELETED**

**Article Status (as of October 2025):**
- ❌ Original article: DELETED (404 error)
- ✅ Correction article published: https://crux.org.nz/crux-news/crux-story-found-to-be-inaccurate-and-misleading

**Verified Findings:**
✅ **Correction article published:** 22 December 2022 (10 days after Media Council ruling)
✅ **Media Council summary included:** Yes, the correction article contains a comprehensive summary of the Media Council's findings
✅ **Link to Media Council:** Yes, states "The full Media Council ruling can be found on its website https://www.mediacouncil.org.nz/"
❌ **Link to specific ruling:** No - links to homepage, not to case-3356 specifically
❌ **Original article deleted:** The original article "QLDC engineer writes own $448,000 consulting deal" has been completely removed
✅ **Fair prominence:** The correction article appears in the main news section and is searchable

**Compliance Assessment:**

- **CRITICAL ISSUE:** The Media Council states "All enduring electronic copy that the Council has ruled to be in breach of its Principles must carry a note at the top of the copy that it has been found in breach and why"
- **INTERPRETATION QUESTION:** Does deleting the original article comply with the "enduring electronic copy" requirement, or should the original article remain online with a breach notice?
- **POSITIVE:** Crux did publish a comprehensive correction article with fair prominence
- **NEGATIVE:** Readers cannot see the original article to understand what was inaccurate

## Final Conclusions

Based on the deep dive investigation of all three upheld complaints:

### Summary of Compliance Status

1. **Case 2891 (Wide Body Jets):** ✅ **MOSTLY COMPLIANT**
   - Breach notice present with appropriate wording
   - Links to Media Council (though not to specific ruling)
   - Article remains online with breach notice at top
   - **Minor issue:** Link should go to specific ruling, not homepage

2. **Case 2940 (Airport Land Purchase):** ❌ **NON-COMPLIANT**
   - Breach notice present BUT critical corrections NOT made
   - **HEADLINE STILL CONTAINS "REDUNDANT"** - directly contradicts Media Council ruling
   - Unable to verify if other corrections (captions, balance) were made
   - Two other articles cited in complaint cannot be located
   - **This is a serious breach of Media Council requirements**

3. **Case 3356 (Andrew Tipene):** ⚠️ **QUESTIONABLE COMPLIANCE**
   - Original article deleted entirely
   - Correction article published with comprehensive summary
   - **Question:** Does deletion comply with "enduring electronic copy" requirement?
   - Positive: Correction article has fair prominence

### Critical Non-Compliance Issues Identified

#### 1. **Case 2940: Failure to Correct Headline**
**Status:** ❌ **SERIOUS NON-COMPLIANCE**

The Media Council specifically ruled (paragraph 54):
> "Its redundancy is not a fact and nor is the $200m price stated in the headline... Because of its unsupported contentions that the land is no longer needed or redundant Crux is in breach of Media Council Principle 1 (accuracy, fairness and balance) and Principle 6 (headlines and captions)."

**Current headline (October 2025):** "Airport risks bank limits over redundant $200 million land purchase"

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Remove the word "redundant" from the headline immediately.

**IMPACT:** This is a direct violation of the Media Council's ruling. The breach notice acknowledges the ruling but the article itself has not been corrected. This undermines the entire purpose of the Media Council process.

#### 2. **Case 2940: Missing Articles**
**Status:** ❌ **NON-COMPLIANCE**

The Media Council ruling covered THREE articles:
1. ✅ "Airport risks bank limits over redundant $200 million land purchase" (19 June 2020) - FOUND
2. ❌ "Into the Danger Zone – is something Very Bad about to happen with our airports?" (2 May 2020) - NOT FOUND
3. ❌ "Will the Bank of China need to rescue Queenstown Airport's debts?" (7 July 2020) - NOT FOUND

**REQUIRED ACTION:** Locate these articles and add breach notices, or if deleted, this may violate the "enduring electronic copy" requirement.

#### 3. **Case 3356: Deletion of Original Article**
**Status:** ⚠️ **QUESTIONABLE**

The Media Council states: "All enduring electronic copy that the Council has ruled to be in breach of its Principles must carry a note at the top of the copy that it has been found in breach and why."

**Question:** Does deleting the original article comply with this requirement?

**Arguments for compliance:**
- Crux published a comprehensive correction article
- The correction has fair prominence
- Readers are informed of the breach

**Arguments against compliance:**
- The original "enduring electronic copy" no longer exists
- Readers cannot see what was originally published
- The requirement specifically says the copy "must carry a note" - implying it should remain

**RECOMMENDATION:** Seek clarification from Media Council on whether deletion is acceptable.

#### 4. **Linking to Specific Rulings**
**Status:** ⚠️ **MINOR ISSUE**

All three articles link to www.mediacouncil.org.nz (homepage) rather than the specific ruling pages:
- Should link to: www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-2891
- Should link to: www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-2940
- Should link to: www.mediacouncil.org.nz/rulings/case-3356

**IMPACT:** Minor - readers can still find the rulings, but specific links would be better practice.

---

## Required Corrective Actions

### IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED:

1. **Case 2940 - Correct the headline:**
   - Current: "Airport risks bank limits over redundant $200 million land purchase"
   - Required: "Airport risks bank limits over $200 million land purchase" (remove "redundant")
   - OR: "Airport faces financing challenges for $200 million land purchase"

2. **Case 2940 - Locate missing articles:**
   - Search Crux archives for the May 2 and July 7 articles
   - If found: Add breach notices to both articles
   - If deleted: This may constitute non-compliance with "enduring electronic copy" requirement

3. **Case 2940 - Verify other corrections:**
   - Check if caption about Adrienne Young-Cooper was corrected
   - Check if QAC's response about no share sale was added for balance

4. **All cases - Update links:**
   - Change links from www.mediacouncil.org.nz to specific ruling pages
   - This is a minor improvement but demonstrates good faith compliance

### RECOMMENDED ACTIONS:

5. **Case 3356 - Clarify deletion policy:**
   - Contact Media Council to confirm whether deletion of original article is acceptable
   - If not acceptable, consider restoring the original article with breach notice at top

6. **Social media compliance:**
   - Check if articles were shared on Facebook/social media
   - If so, add breach notices to those posts as required by Media Council

7. **Corrections page:**
   - Consider creating a dedicated corrections page listing all upheld complaints
   - This would demonstrate transparency and good faith compliance

---

## Overall Assessment

**Compliance Score:**
- Case 2891: 85% compliant (minor linking issue)
- Case 2940: 40% compliant (breach notice present but corrections not made)
- Case 3356: 70% compliant (correction published but original deleted)

**Overall: 65% COMPLIANT**

**Key Finding:** Crux has made efforts to comply by adding breach notices, but has FAILED to make the specific corrections required by the Media Council, particularly in Case 2940 where the headline still contains the word "redundant" that was specifically ruled to be inaccurate.

**Recommendation:** Crux should immediately correct the headline in Case 2940 and locate/add breach notices to the two missing articles. This is not optional - it is required by the Media Council's ruling.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Share this report** with relevant stakeholders
2. **Contact Media Council** to:
   - Report non-compliance with Case 2940 headline correction
   - Seek clarification on deletion policy for Case 3356
   - Request verification of whether Crux has fulfilled all requirements
3. **Monitor for changes** - Check if Crux makes corrections after this report
4. **Document evidence** - Take screenshots of current article states for the record
5. **Consider formal complaint** - If Crux does not make required corrections, consider filing a complaint with the Media Council about non-compliance with their ruling
