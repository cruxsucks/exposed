## Executive Summary

This article presents serious concerns about QLDC's CEO recruitment process, specifically the timing and transparency of Mayor Lewers' actions. However, the article raises significant ethical journalism concerns under NZMC Principles 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance), 4 (Comment and Fact), and 11 (Conflicts of Interest).

**Key Issues Identified:**
1. **Opinion presented as news** - Article mixes factual claims with editorial opinion without clear labeling
2. **Inadequate right of reply** - No evidence that Mayor Lewers, committee members, or QLDC staff were given opportunity to respond to serious allegations before publication
3. **Lack of balance** - One-sided presentation focused on Gladding's concerns without presenting alternative perspectives
4. **Conflict of interest** - Sitting councillor uses media platform during election period to advance political position
5. **Speculative claims presented as fact** - Multiple assertions lack supporting evidence or context

**NZMC Historical Pattern:** This article exhibits the same failures identified in Crux's three upheld NZMC complaints (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356), particularly regarding fact/opinion distinction and inadequate right of reply.

## Analysis Against NZMC Principles

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance

**Status:** LIKELY BREACHED

#### Accuracy Issues

**1. Claim: "Mayor Lewers used a non-existent delegated financial authority"**
- Article states Mayor "does not have an individual financial delegation" (line 62)
- This is presented as fact but requires verification
- No evidence that Mayor Lewers or QLDC were asked to explain the authority used
- Possible alternative explanations not explored (e.g., joint authority, council resolution, emergency powers)

**2. Claim: "The selection of a recruitment agent was limited to existing QLDC suppliers and therefore less likely to produce 'fresh blood'"**
- The "therefore" represents opinion, not fact
- No evidence provided that using existing panel suppliers reduces quality
- No comparison made to alternative procurement methods
- Speculative causation presented as established fact

**3. Claim: "The CEO's pay and performance committee has no remit to get involved"**
- Article asserts this categorically (line 17, 42)
- No evidence of seeking legal opinion, checking committee terms of reference, or consulting governance experts
- CE Theelen's agreement mentioned but no formal authority cited
- Presents one interpretation as definitive fact

**4. Claim: Process "appears almost identical to the one used five years ago – which produced a shortlist of one candidate"**
- Word "appears" indicates speculation
- No documented comparison provided
- Historical context (why that process was structured that way) not explored
- Presented in bullet points as "key fact" despite being speculation

**5. Timeline Accuracy**
- August 4: Procurement Plan signed
- August 5: Councillors told of Theelen resignation
- Article presents this one-day difference as evidence of deliberate concealment
- Alternative explanations not considered (e.g., resignation finalized August 4, communication prepared August 5, administrative timing)

#### Fairness Issues

**No Evidence of Right of Reply:**

The article makes serious allegations against multiple parties but provides no indication they were contacted for comment:

1. **Mayor Lewers** - Accused of:
   - Starting recruitment before informing councillors
   - Using "non-existent" authority
   - Incorrectly categorizing stakeholders
   - Operating inappropriately during election period
   - **No evidence he was asked to respond**

2. **Committee Members (Guy and Cocks)** - Accused of:
   - Having "no remit" for involvement
   - Getting stakeholder categories "wrong"
   - Acting as voting members inappropriately
   - **No evidence they were asked to respond**

3. **CE Mike Theelen** - Accused of:
   - Failing to involve elected members
   - Focus on confidentiality over transparency
   - Allowing inappropriate process
   - Article mentions Gladding "encouraged" him to release plan (line 52)
   - Gives him "a few days" (line 22) - suggesting ultimatum, not dialogue

4. **People and Capability Director** - Named as having $650,000 delegation that "was not used" with no explanation sought

5. **Two Staff Members** - Referenced as getting stakeholder categories wrong (line 78) but not identified or given opportunity to explain

**Historical Pattern:** This mirrors Case 3356 where Media Council found Crux's reliance "only on social media seems a paltry effort" and that they "should have given [subject] opportunity to comment before publication." The Council stated Crux "does not appear to have seriously engaged" with subjects.

#### Balance Issues

**One-Sided Presentation:**

1. **Process Framing** - Article presents Gladding's concerns as established problems without presenting:
   - Why closed tender might be appropriate for senior executive recruitment (confidentiality, candidate sensitivity)
   - Industry best practices for CEO recruitment
   - Legal advice received by QLDC on process
   - Whether similar processes are used by other councils

2. **Committee Authority** - Only Gladding's interpretation presented:
   - No reference to committee terms of reference
   - No legal opinion cited
   - No governance expert consulted
   - CE's agreement mentioned but dismissed as insufficient

3. **Timing During Election** - Framed as inappropriate:
   - No acknowledgement that CEO contract extension deadline might require action
   - No explanation of what alternative timeline would look like
   - No consideration that delaying until after election could be equally problematic

4. **Risk Assessment** - Article criticizes risk management but:
   - Doesn't present what risks were assessed
   - Doesn't explain what additional risks should have been considered
   - Provides only Gladding's view of adequate risk management

5. **Panel Procurement** - Criticized as limiting options but:
   - No information on how panel was originally procured
   - No comparison to alternative approaches
   - No evidence that panel limits quality
   - Standard procurement practice not acknowledged

**Missing Context:**

- Local government procurement regulations and requirements
- Standard CEO recruitment practices in New Zealand councils
- Legal framework for delegated authority in local government
- Reasons for confidentiality in executive recruitment
- Time constraints or deadlines driving process timing

**Historical Pattern:** This mirrors Case 2891 where Media Council found Crux "did not seek comment on substantive issues" and there was "lack of balance - only sought documents, didn't ask questions."

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact

**Status:** LIKELY BREACHED

#### Blurring of Opinion and Fact

**1. Article Structure Creates Confusion:**

- Presented as news article with factual headline
- Editor's Note frames it as document-based reporting revealing facts
- "Key points" presented as bullet-point facts (lines 11-24)
- Gladding's piece titled "Fact-checking the CE recruitment process"
- Section headed "Providing clarity – the facts" (lines 56-93)

**Yet the article extensively mixes opinion:**

- "I'm deeply concerned" (line 50)
- "For me, because we're in the middle of an election, providing clarity is both important and urgent" (lines 54-55)
- Multiple uses of interpretive language: "appears", "seems", "likely"
- Evaluative judgments presented alongside factual claims

**2. Specific Examples of Opinion Presented as Fact:**

**Line 13:** "non-existent delegated financial authority"
- This is Gladding's interpretation/opinion
- Requires legal/procedural analysis
- Presented as established fact

**Line 15-16:** "limited to existing QLDC suppliers and therefore less likely to produce 'fresh blood'"
- The causation is opinion
- No evidence provided
- Presented as logical conclusion

**Line 17:** "has no remit to get involved"
- Legal/procedural interpretation
- Gladding's view, not established fact
- Presented categorically

**Line 24:** "appears almost identical"
- Explicitly speculative ("appears")
- Yet included in "key points" as if factual
- No documented comparison provided

**Lines 91-93:** Assessment that prior process meant "in real terms, the decision was made before they even got to the table"
- This is opinion about meaningfulness of decision
- Presented as analysis based on experience
- But mixed into section titled "the facts"

**3. Editor's Role Amplifies Problem:**

The Editor's Note (lines 6-24) presents Gladding's opinions as verified facts:
- "these are the key points revealed by the documents"
- Lists claims without qualification as if independently verified
- No indication that these are Gladding's interpretations
- No acknowledgment of missing perspectives

**This creates impression that Crux has fact-checked the claims when article is actually publishing Gladding's perspective.**

**4. Language Signals Opinion Disguised as Fact:**

Throughout article, interpretive/evaluative language is used:
- "incorrect" (lines 74, 76) - legal/procedural interpretation
- "inappropriately" (line 42) - value judgment
- "errors" (line 78) - assumes conclusion without verification
- "clearly involved" (line 40) - interpretation of communications
- "significant chunk" (line 40) - subjective assessment
- "paltry effort" - direct opinion

**Historical Pattern:** This closely mirrors issues in Cases 2891, 2895, and 2940:

- **Case 2891:** "Mixed opinion with news without clear labeling"
- **Case 2895:** Media Council warned about "amount of opinion liberally sprinkled through a story presented as news" and "strongly suggests Crux take greater care"
- **Case 2940:** "Speculative opinion presented as factual report"

#### Proper Labeling Absent

**Article Should Be Clearly Labeled:**

Given the content, this should be published as:
- Opinion piece by Councillor Niki Gladding
- Analysis: Concerns about CEO recruitment process
- Commentary: One councillor's view on procurement issues

**Instead:**
- Presented as news with factual headline
- Editor's Note legitimizes as fact-based reporting
- Section headings claim to provide "facts" and "clarity"
- Published in news section, not opinion section

**NZMC Principle 4 Requirements:**
- "A clear distinction should be drawn between factual information and comment or opinion"
- "An article that is essentially comment or opinion should be clearly presented as such"
- "Material facts on which an opinion is based should be accurate"

**This article fails all three requirements.**

---

### Principle 11: Conflicts of Interest

**Status:** LIKELY BREACHED

#### Multiple Conflicts Present

**1. Councillor Using Media Platform:**

- Niki Gladding is sitting QLDC councillor
- Uses Crux to advance political position on council governance issue
- During election period when candidates are making competing claims
- Platform provides her views greater reach and legitimacy than other participants

**2. Election Timing:**

Lines 54-55: "For me, because we're in the middle of an election, providing clarity is both important and urgent."

- Gladding explicitly connects article to election context
- Mayor Lewers is candidate in election
- Other committee members may be candidates
- Article potentially influences election by one-sided criticism of Mayor's actions

**3. Political Positioning:**

Line 32: "I hope the next Council, under a new Mayor, will consider pushing 'restart' on this process."

- This is political advocacy for change in leadership
- Published during election when mayoral race is contested
- Uses article platform to advocate for political outcome

**4. Councillor's Role vs. Media Role:**

- As councillor, Gladding has internal channels for concerns (council meetings, formal complaints, internal procedures)
- As councillor, she could request extraordinary meeting on CEO recruitment
- As councillor, she could bring formal motion about process concerns
- Instead uses media publication to pressure CEO and criticize Mayor publicly

**5. Auditor General Complaint:**

Line 100: "Given those concerns I will be making a complaint to the Office of the Auditor General."

- Uses article to announce formal complaint
- Article becomes part of public campaign around complaint
- Blurs line between legitimate news reporting and councillor's political advocacy

#### Crux's Role in Conflict

**Editor's Note as Amplification:**

The Editor's Note doesn't acknowledge or mitigate conflicts:
- No disclosure that this is sitting councillor with political interests
- No acknowledgment of election timing sensitivities
- No indication of efforts to balance with other perspectives
- Instead, actively legitimizes Gladding's claims as "key points revealed"

**Standard Practice Would Require:**

- Clear disclosure of Gladding's role and interests
- Acknowledgment of election context
- Efforts to obtain responses from all parties criticized
- Balance with alternative perspectives
- Clear labeling as opinion/commentary, not news
- Editorial independence in verifying claims before publication

**NZMC Principle 11:**
"Publications should not allow advertising or commercial considerations or personal interests to influence the content, presentation, or commentary of publications."

While Principle 11 focuses on commercial interests, the underlying concern applies: **personal political interests (Gladding's) appear to have influenced content and presentation without adequate disclosure or mitigation.**

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions

**Status:** POTENTIALLY BREACHED

#### Headline Analysis

**Headline:** "Lewers launched recruitment process before telling councillors that Theelen had resigned"

**Issues:**

**1. States Conclusion as Fact:**
- Headline presents timing issue as established fact
- Actually based on document interpretation (Plan signed Aug 4, councillors told Aug 5)
- Alternative explanations for one-day timing not considered
- Presents Gladding's interpretation as verified fact

**2. Implies Improper Motive:**
- "before telling councillors" suggests deliberate concealment
- Creates impression of wrongdoing
- Alternative explanations (administrative timing, coordination, when resignation was finalized) not reflected
- Prejudges Mayor's actions

**3. Not Fairly Representative:**
- Headline emphasizes only one aspect of article
- Doesn't reflect that article is councillor's opinion/concerns
- Doesn't indicate this is disputed interpretation
- Makes categorical claim that article's content doesn't fully support

**Comparison to Body:**
- Line 60 states Plan was "signed on 4 August 2025, the day before councillors were told"
- This is factual: documents dated Aug 4, communication Aug 5
- But headline interprets this as "launched...before telling" - which assumes sequence proves improper intent

**Historical Pattern:** This mirrors Cases 2940 and 3356 where NZMC found:
- **Case 2940:** "Headlines stated speculation as fact"
- **Case 3356:** "Inaccurate headline and characterization"
- Both cases upheld under Principle 6

**NZMC Principle 6:**
"Headlines, sub-headings, and captions should accurately and fairly convey the substance or a key element of the report they accompany. They should not mislead readers or misrepresent."

**This headline potentially misrepresents by:**
- Stating interpretation as fact
- Implying improper motive without evidence
- Not acknowledging disputed nature of claims

---

## Additional Concerns

### Timing and Electoral Context

**Significant Issues:**

**1. Publication During Election Period:**
- Article published September 28, 2025
- States "we're in the middle of an election" (line 54)
- Mayor Lewers is electoral candidate
- Article contains serious allegations against Mayor
- One-sided presentation could influence election outcome

**2. Gladding's Political Positioning:**
- Line 22: "Niki Gladding is giving CEO Mike Theelen a few days to release more information before she reconsiders her position"
- Unclear what "reconsider her position" means - resignation? Further action?
- Creates public pressure through media rather than internal processes
- Line 32: Explicitly hopes for "new Mayor" to restart process

**3. Potential Electoral Impact:**
- Article titled as news but advances political position
- Published by sitting councillor targeting mayor during election
- No balancing perspectives from other councillors, candidates, or experts
- Could materially affect election outcome through one-sided presentation

**NZMC Standards:**
While not explicit principle, Media Council has noted in multiple cases the importance of fairness and balance, especially in controversial matters. Publishing serious one-sided allegations against electoral candidate during election period, without right of reply, raises significant ethical concerns.

### Confidentiality and Document Release

**Ethical Questions:**

**1. Gladding's Decision to Release Content:**

Lines 51-52: "Given the level of public interest, the importance of the CE role, and the fact that the appointment of the recruiter has been made, I don't believe there are grounds for keeping the plan 'confidential'. So, I've encouraged the CE to release it."

Lines 58-59: "If the organization thinks these facts are incorrect, it can release the full document"

- Gladding obtained document marked confidential
- Unilaterally decides to publish content
- Frames release as CE's choice while publishing content anyway
- Creates situation where QLDC must release full document to defend itself

**2. Crux's Decision to Publish:**

- No indication Crux sought independent verification of confidentiality status
- No evidence of legal review of Gladding's right to publish
- No indication of consultation with QLDC about confidentiality claims
- Published content that Gladding herself acknowledges is marked confidential

**3. Public Interest Defense:**

- Article assumes public interest justifies confidentiality breach
- No independent assessment of competing interests:
  - CEO candidate privacy
  - Recruitment process integrity
  - Commercial sensitivity for recruitment firms
  - Council's legal obligations
- Gladding and Crux make this determination unilaterally

**Standard Practice Would Require:**
- Legal review of confidentiality obligations
- Consultation with parties affected by release
- Independent assessment of public interest vs. confidentiality
- Consideration of whether redacted or summary information would suffice

---

### Process vs. Outcome Focus

**Article's Emphasis:**

The article focuses extensively on **process concerns** rather than **substantive problems**:

1. **Timing** (August 4 vs. August 5) - one-day difference
2. **Committee authority** - whether committee should be involved
3. **Procurement method** - closed vs. open tender
4. **Stakeholder categorization** - whether RASCI tool was correctly applied
5. **Communication timing** - when councillors were informed

**Missing:**

1. **Evidence of harm** - No allegation that recruitment was compromised, biased, or incompetent
2. **Evidence of improper motive** - Speculation about intent but no evidence
3. **Evidence of violation** - No legal opinion that laws/regulations were broken
4. **Comparative analysis** - No evidence that process differs from standard practice
5. **Alternative perspectives** - No experts, other councillors, or governance specialists consulted

**Effect:**

Article reads as procedural complaint elevated to apparent scandal through:
- Dramatic framing ("the facts", "providing clarity")
- Serious allegations ("non-existent authority", "errors")
- Election timing implications
- Public interest justification

But lacks substantive evidence of wrongdoing beyond process disagreements.

---

## Historical Context: Crux's Pattern

### Repeat Offending

This article exhibits the same failures found in Crux's three upheld NZMC complaints:

**Case 2891 (March 2020) - UPHELD:**
- Failed to give QLDC right of reply
- Did not seek comment on substantive issues
- Mixed opinion with news without clear labeling
- Lack of balance

**Case 2940 (September 2020) - UPHELD:**
- Speculative opinion presented as factual report
- Failed to report response that contradicted narrative
- Headlines stated speculation as fact
- Media Council noted "serious breakdown in professional relationship" with QLDC

**Case 3356 (December 2022) - UPHELD:**
- Should have given subject opportunity to comment before publication
- "Reliance only on social media seems a paltry effort"
- Media Council "disappointed by Crux's conduct"
- "Crux does not appear to have seriously engaged"
- Council noted this was "at least the 5th complaint from QLDC, its subsidiaries, or contractors"

### Current Article Exhibits Same Failures

**1. Inadequate Right of Reply:**
- No evidence Mayor Lewers given opportunity to respond
- No evidence committee members asked for comment
- No evidence of serious attempt to obtain QLDC perspective
- Mirrors Case 3356's "paltry effort" finding

**2. Opinion Presented as Fact:**
- Interpretations presented as "key points" and "facts"
- Speculative claims mixed with documented facts
- Article titled "Fact-checking" but actually presents opinions
- Mirrors Cases 2891, 2895, 2940 findings on fact/opinion distinction

**3. Lack of Balance:**
- Only Gladding's perspective presented
- Alternative explanations not explored
- No expert or comparative analysis
- Mirrors Case 2891's "lack of balance" finding

**4. Headlines State Interpretation as Fact:**
- Headline presents timing issue as established wrongdoing
- Doesn't reflect disputed nature of claims
- Mirrors Case 2940 and 3356 findings on headlines

**5. Deteriorating QLDC Relationship:**
- Article continues pattern of one-sided criticism
- Published by councillor creates additional conflict
- No evidence of attempt at constructive engagement
- Mirrors Case 2940's "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism"

### Media Council's Prior Warnings to Crux

**May 2020 (Case 2895):**
"Strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future"

**September 2020 (Case 2940):**
Noted "serious breakdown in professional relationship" and "festering mutual suspicion"

**December 2022 (Case 3356):**
"Disappointed by Crux's conduct" and reminded: "Even if other matters it is pursuing are verifiable and important that does not detract from its obligations in relation to other stories it publishes"

**Current Article:**
Demonstrates Crux has not heeded these warnings. Same patterns persist 3 years after most recent upheld complaint.

---

## Mitigating Factors

**In fairness, several factors potentially reduce severity:**

### 1. Public Interest

- CEO recruitment is legitimate matter of public concern
- QLDC spending and governance are appropriate journalism subjects
- Transparency in public sector recruitment is important democratic value
- Gladding's concerns, if valid, represent significant governance issues

### 2. Document-Based Reporting

- Article is based on official Procurement Plan document
- Specific dates and details are cited
- Gladding obtained document through legitimate channels
- Not based solely on rumor or speculation

### 3. Crux's Advocacy Role

- Crux describes itself as advocacy journalism platform
- Media Council has acknowledged this is legitimate journalism approach
- Crux has successfully exposed real QLDC governance issues in past (acknowledged in Case 3012)
- Platform serves watchdog function in region

### 4. Gladding's Position

- As councillor, Gladding has legitimate role in oversight
- She has access to documents and internal information
- Her concerns are sincerely held and detailed
- She is accountable to voters for her positions

### 5. Responsive to Prior Criticism

- Article does cite specific documents rather than unsupported claims
- More detailed and evidence-based than some prior controversial articles
- Gladding announces formal complaint to Auditor General (external verification process)

### 6. CE Theelen's Position

- Article notes CE agreed committee involvement would be inappropriate (line 42)
- This suggests at least some consultation occurred
- CE hasn't released documents despite request (implicit acknowledgment of concerns?)

---

## What Would Ethical Publication Look Like?

**To meet NZMC standards, this article should have:**

### 1. Right of Reply (Principle 1)

**Before publication, Crux should have:**
- Contacted Mayor Lewers with specific allegations and deadline for response
- Contacted committee members (Guy, Cocks) for their perspective
- Contacted CE Theelen for formal response (not just Gladding's characterization of email exchange)
- Contacted People and Capability Director about financial delegation
- Included all responses prominently in article
- If parties declined comment, stated this explicitly

### 2. Balance (Principle 1)

**Article should have included:**
- Perspectives from other councillors on process concerns
- Expert opinion on local government CEO recruitment best practices
- Comparison to how other councils handle similar situations
- Legal/governance expert on committee authority and delegation questions
- Alternative explanations for timing and process decisions
- Context on why confidentiality might be appropriate in executive recruitment

### 3. Fact/Opinion Distinction (Principle 4)

**Article should have:**
- Been clearly labeled as "Opinion" or "Commentary by Councillor Niki Gladding"
- Distinguished between documented facts (dates, document content) and interpretations (whether authority was proper, whether process was inadequate)
- Used language that signals opinion: "Gladding believes", "in her view", "one interpretation is"
- Editor's Note should acknowledge these are Gladding's concerns, not independently verified facts
- Section headings should not claim "facts" for interpretive content

### 4. Accurate Headlines (Principle 6)

**Headline should reflect:**
- That article presents one councillor's concerns
- That claims are disputed or interpretive
- Not state conclusion as established fact

**Alternative headlines:**
- "Councillor Gladding raises concerns about CEO recruitment process"
- "Questions emerge about timing of QLDC CEO recruitment"
- "Procurement documents show mayor's role in CEO search, councillor says"

### 5. Conflict Disclosure (Principle 11)

**Article should include:**
- Clear disclosure that Gladding is sitting councillor with governance role
- Acknowledgment of election timing and potential political dimensions
- Disclosure of Gladding's hope for "new Mayor" (political position)
- Editorial independence through verification and balance

### 6. Confidentiality Handling

**Ethical approach would include:**
- Legal review of Gladding's ability to disclose confidential document
- Consultation with QLDC about confidentiality before publication
- Assessment of whether redacted or summary publication would suffice
- Consideration of impacts on recruitment process and candidates
- Clear explanation of public interest justification

### Example of Balanced Approach

**Hypothetical opening with balance:**

"Queenstown Lakes District Councillor Niki Gladding has raised concerns about the process used to recruit the district's next Chief Executive, questioning whether proper authority and consultation procedures were followed.

In documents obtained by Cr Gladding, a procurement plan for hiring a recruitment agency was signed by Mayor Lewers on August 4, one day before councillors were informed that CE Mike Theelen would not be seeking a contract extension.

Mayor Lewers declined to comment before publication. [Or: Mayor Lewers said the process followed appropriate protocols and that timing was driven by contract extension deadlines. He noted that...]

QLDC Chief Executive Mike Theelen said... [response to specific allegations]

Local government expert [name] said CEO recruitment processes vary across councils but typically involve... [context and comparison]"

**This approach:**
- Still reports Gladding's concerns
- Provides context and balance
- Gives parties opportunity to respond
- Doesn't prejudge outcome
- Meets NZMC standards for fairness and accuracy

---

## Recommendations

### For Potential Complainant

**Strongest Grounds for Complaint:**

**1. Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance) - LIKELY TO SUCCEED**
- No evidence of adequate right of reply to Mayor Lewers
- No evidence of attempts to contact committee members
- One-sided presentation without alternative perspectives
- Historical pattern: Upheld in Cases 2891, 2940, 3356

**2. Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - LIKELY TO SUCCEED**
- Opinion presented as news throughout
- Section titled "the facts" contains interpretations
- Editor's Note legitimizes opinions as verified facts
- Not clearly labeled as opinion piece
- Historical pattern: Upheld in Cases 2891, 2940

**3. Principle 6 (Headlines) - MODERATE CHANCE**
- Headline states interpretation as fact
- Implies improper motive without evidence
- Doesn't reflect disputed nature of claims
- Historical pattern: Upheld in Cases 2940, 3356

**Weaker Grounds:**

**Principle 11 (Conflicts of Interest) - DIFFICULT**
- Principle typically applies to commercial conflicts
- Political conflict is present but not explicitly covered
- Could argue as supplementary concern

### Complaint Procedure

**Step 1: Complain to Crux (Required)**
- Must be within 1 month of publication (by October 28, 2025)
- Send to editor/publisher
- Specify which NZMC Principles allegedly breached
- Request correction, apology, or other remedy
- Maximum 500 words

**Step 2: Complain to Media Council**
- Only if unsatisfied with Crux's response
- Within 20 working days of Crux's response
- Sign waiver that this is only formal action (no concurrent legal proceedings)
- Submit evidence and correspondence

### Key Evidence to Gather

1. **Article as published** (already have)
2. **Any response from Crux/Gladding** to initial complaint
3. **Evidence re: right of reply:**
   - Any public statements from Mayor Lewers, committee members about whether they were contacted
   - QLDC communications about whether Crux sought comment
4. **Comparative evidence:**
   - How other councils handle CEO recruitment
   - Expert opinions on local government governance
   - Standard practices for executive recruitment confidentiality
5. **Prior NZMC decisions** (already have)
6. **Election context:**
   - Evidence this is election period
   - Evidence of candidates involved

### Potential Complainants

**Who has standing:**

1. **Mayor Lewers** - Directly named, serious allegations, not given right of reply
2. **Committee members (Guy, Cocks)** - Named, accused of errors, not given right of reply
3. **CE Mike Theelen** - Named, criticized, though some consultation occurred
4. **QLDC as organization** - Criticized, process questioned, relationship with Crux historically difficult
5. **Other councillors** - If they believe their governance role was misrepresented
6. **Recruitment firms** - If identified and concerned about reputational impact

**Most Likely Complainant:** Mayor Lewers or QLDC, as they have clearest standing and strongest interest in pursuing complaint.

## Conclusion

### Summary of Findings

This article exhibits significant breaches of NZMC Principles, particularly:

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance):**
   - No evidence of adequate right of reply to Mayor Lewers or committee members
   - One-sided presentation without balancing perspectives
   - Interpretations presented as facts without verification

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact):**
   - Opinion piece presented as news reporting
   - Speculative claims mixed with documented facts
   - Section headings claim "facts" for interpretive content
   - Not clearly labeled as opinion or commentary

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines):**
   - Headline states interpretation as established fact
   - Implies improper motive without supporting evidence
   - Doesn't reflect disputed nature of claims

### Historical Pattern

**This article demonstrates Crux has not addressed issues raised in three upheld NZMC complaints (2020-2022):**

- Same failure to provide adequate right of reply (Cases 2891, 3356)
- Same mixing of opinion with news reporting (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940)
- Same lack of balance in presenting controversy (Cases 2891, 2940)
- Same pattern of one-sided QLDC criticism (all five cases)

**Media Council's escalating warnings have not been heeded:**
- 2020: "Strongly suggests Crux take greater care"
- 2020: Noted "serious breakdown in professional relationship"
- 2022: "Disappointed by Crux's conduct"

### Legitimate Public Interest

**Despite ethical breaches, article addresses genuine concerns:**

- CEO recruitment process transparency is legitimate public interest
- Questions about delegated authority are appropriate governance matters
- Timing and communication with elected members are valid concerns
- Gladding has legitimate role in oversight as councillor

**The problem is not the story, but how it was reported.**

### Impact Assessment

**Potential harms from publication approach:**

1. **Electoral Impact:** One-sided allegations against Mayor during election could influence outcome without fair opportunity for response
2. **Reputational Harm:** Serious allegations without right of reply damage individuals' reputations
3. **Process Interference:** Public campaign may prejudice legitimate recruitment process
4. **Democratic Function:** Voters receive unbalanced information during election period
5. **Professional Relationships:** Continues pattern of antagonistic QLDC-Crux relationship

### Likelihood of NZMC Complaint Success

**Based on historical precedent and current facts:**

**Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance): 80% likely to be upheld**
- Clear failure to provide right of reply
- Precedent from Cases 2891, 2940, 3356
- No evidence of serious attempt to contact criticized parties

**Principle 4 (Comment and Fact): 75% likely to be upheld**
- Opinion clearly presented as news
- Precedent from Cases 2891, 2940
- Section headings explicitly claim "facts" for opinions

**Principle 6 (Headlines): 60% likely to be upheld**
- Headline states interpretation as fact
- Precedent from Cases 2940, 3356
- Less clear-cut than other breaches but pattern exists

**Overall Assessment: Very strong likelihood of at least partial upheld complaint**

### Final Assessment

**This article represents a significant failure of ethical journalism standards.**

While Crux serves an important watchdog function and the underlying concerns may be legitimate, the publication method violates multiple NZMC Principles that Crux has been repeatedly warned about.

The combination of:
- No evidence of right of reply
- Opinion presented as news
- Publication during election period
- Serious allegations without verification
- Councillor using media platform for political advocacy
- Historical pattern of similar failures

...creates a compelling case for NZMC complaint.

**Key Question:** Has Crux learned from previous upheld complaints, or does this represent continuation of problematic practices?

**Answer:** This article suggests Crux has not addressed the core issues identified in three upheld complaints over 2020-2022. The same failures persist.

**Review completed:** October 3, 2025
**Recommendation:** Strong grounds exist for NZMC complaint under Principles 1, 4, and 6
**Historical context:** This would be at least the 6th complaint against Crux regarding QLDC coverage
