# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Facebook Comments on QLDC Consultant Spending
**Publication:** Crux (Facebook Platform)
**Date:** 3 years ago (approximately 2022)
**Author:** Community Discussion Thread
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This document represents a collection of Facebook comments from a Crux article discussion thread about QLDC consultant spending. The content consists primarily of public commentary and community reactions rather than editorial content published by Crux itself. While the comments raise legitimate concerns about consultant spending and council accountability, they are user-generated content on social media. As such, they fall outside the direct scope of NZMC principles which apply to published editorial content. However, Crux's role in moderating and curating such discussions, and any editorial framing provided, could be subject to professional standards.

---

## Article Summary
The document presents a compilation of Facebook comments from a community discussion thread related to QLDC consultant spending. The comments include:

- **James Porteous**: Criticism of lack of transparency and accountability for consultant spending, noting absence of bottom-line reporting and results accountability
- **Andrew Patchett**: Brief statement that rates primarily fund consultants rather than benefiting the town
- **Jay Moore**: Comments about consultant costs being invoiced to developers through building permits, with follow-up noting $448k doesn't seem excessive over the period
- **Edward Coad**: Colorful criticism using metaphor to criticize QLDC
- **Olly Black**: Moderate view that consultant fees don't seem excessive for 4-5 years
- **Rickard Robl**: Comments about toxic workplace environments and remote work patterns
- **James Porteous** (second comment): Questioning whether consultant amounts consistently in $400-500k range indicates an "understanding" on rates
- **Jessica Hinsen**: Two tag comments (Aaron Waldron)
- **Nathan Katene**: Strong language criticizing situation
- **Susan Manson**: Hashtag calling for CEO to go (#CEOneedstogo)
- **Leeann Morton**: Thanks to Crux for investigative follow-up

The document includes a summary section identifying key themes: lack of accountability, cost concerns, rate impact, developer costs, leadership criticism, and support for Crux's investigative reporting.

---

## Context Considerations
Per ReviewContext.MD, the Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections are underway. Crux is a local news site that reports on QLDC matters with a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council.

The historical complaints (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940, 3012, 3356) show that Crux has been upheld for breaches in 60% of cases, with consistent issues around:
- Failure to distinguish comment from fact
- Inadequate right of reply
- Lack of balance
- Inaccurate headlines
- Unprofessional conduct including "festering mutual suspicion" with QLDC entities

This context is relevant because:
1. **Electoral Period**: Comments about CEO needing to go and leadership criticism occur during an election period when such criticism could influence voters
2. **Platform Responsibility**: Given Crux's history of NZMC findings regarding professional standards, their moderation and editorial framing of user comments carries particular significance
3. **Pattern Context**: The comments reflect ongoing antagonism between Crux's audience and QLDC, which the Media Council previously described as "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism"

The document appears to be a curated collection of Facebook comments, possibly compiled by Crux or related to a specific Crux article about consultant spending (likely the article referenced in NZMC Case 3356 regarding Andrew Tipene's $448,000 consulting arrangement).

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Limited Applicability / Potential Issues

**Analysis:**

**Nature of Content:**
This is user-generated content on a social media platform, not editorial content published by Crux. NZMC principles primarily apply to "published material" created by the publication, not comments from the public. However, several considerations apply:

1. **Editorial Curation**: If Crux compiled, edited, or presented these comments as representative of community views without editorial context or balance, this could raise fairness issues
2. **Moderation Responsibility**: Publications hosting comment sections have responsibilities regarding the content they allow to remain published
3. **Platform Role**: The summary section (lines 130-146) appears to be editorial analysis by Crux, which would be subject to NZMC principles

**Accuracy Issues (if editorial framing applies):**
- Jay Moore's comment references "$448k over this period" and checking of invoices/timesheets (lines 24-36), which appears to reference specific QLDC information - if Crux presented this without verification, accuracy concerns arise
- The summary section states themes as fact without qualification (lines 130-141)
- References to "friends of the council" (line 9) and implications of cronyism are presented without factual foundation

**Fairness Issues (if editorial framing applies):**
- If Crux selected and presented these comments without including any pro-QLDC or balanced perspectives, this could constitute unfairness
- No comments defending QLDC management, explaining consultant necessity, or providing context for spending
- Comments calling for CEO dismissal (#CEOneedstogo, line 112) published without right of reply
- Strong language ("fuckers", line 101; "clown car...skip fire filled with used diapers", lines 45-46) allowed to stand without moderation

**Balance Issues:**
The comment selection shows entirely critical perspectives:
- No defense of consultant spending as necessary
- No QLDC voice explaining procurement processes
- No context about specialized expertise requirements
- No acknowledgment that Jay Moore actually makes moderate point that fees aren't excessive (lines 54-57, though this is minority view)

**Evidence:**

Summary section states: "Lack of Accountability: Multiple commenters express frustration about the lack of transparency and accountability for consultant spending." (lines 132-133) - This presents one-sided community sentiment as fact without noting QLDC perspective or whether accountability measures exist.

"Support for Crux: Community appreciation for Crux's investigative reporting on these issues." (lines 140-141) - This editorial summary presents Crux's role positively while the underlying issue remains contentious.

Final note: "This appears to be a discussion thread related to QLDC's consultant spending, likely in response to a Crux article about consultant contracts and potential conflicts of interest." (lines 144-146) - Reference to "potential conflicts of interest" presents serious allegation without establishing factual basis.

**Findings:**
If this document represents only user comments, NZMC principles have limited direct application. However, if Crux compiled, curated, or editorially framed these comments (as the summary section suggests), then fairness and balance issues arise. The entirely critical selection without balancing views or QLDC response could constitute breach if presented as representative community sentiment. The editorial summary presents interpretations and characterizations that lack proper factual foundation and balance.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Potential Breach (if editorial content)

**Analysis:**

**Nature of Confusion:**
The document conflates user opinion with factual claims in several ways:

1. **Comment Presentation**: User comments containing opinions and speculation are presented alongside factual-sounding references (invoice amounts, timesheet checking, building permit processes)

2. **Summary as Fact**: The summary section (lines 130-141) presents interpretations as factual findings:
   - "Lack of Accountability" stated as fact rather than commenter perception
   - "Cost Concerns" described without noting whether concerns are factually justified
   - "Leadership Criticism" presented without noting these are opinions during election period

3. **Unverified Claims**: Several comments make factual claims without verification:
   - James Porteous: "amounts consistently seem to be in the 400-500k mark" (line 72) - pattern claim without data
   - Jay Moore: "QLDC also added that they had carefully checked Mr Tipene's invoices" (lines 24-25) - presents QLDC statement without source
   - References to "friends of the council" (line 9) implying corruption without factual basis

**Editorial Voice:**
The final note (lines 144-146) appears to be editorial analysis, not user comment. It states: "likely in response to a Crux article about consultant contracts and potential conflicts of interest" - this presents "potential conflicts of interest" as fact when it may be speculation.

**Lack of Clear Identification:**
If Crux compiled this document:
- Not clearly labeled as "Social Media Comments" or "Reader Reactions"
- No disclaimer that these are user opinions, not verified facts
- No editorial note distinguishing user speculation from established facts
- Summary section blurs line between reporting community sentiment and endorsing it

**Evidence:**

James Porteous states: "money spent on consultants, with what accountability on the result of said 'consultation'" (lines 9-10) - This opinion about accountability is presented in summary as factual theme without noting whether accountability mechanisms actually exist.

Andrew Patchett: "Our rates don't do much for this town except feed these consultants" (lines 17-18) - Opinion stated as fact without data on rate allocation.

Summary: "Rate Impact: Concern that rates are primarily funding consultants rather than benefiting the town." (lines 135-136) - Presents opinion as factual finding about rate allocation.

Nathan Katene: "fuckers" (line 101) - Profanity directed at QLDC allowed to stand, blurring line between legitimate criticism and abuse.

Final editorial note: "potential conflicts of interest" (line 146) - Serious allegation presented as fact without establishing basis.

**Findings:**
If this is editorial content compiled by Crux, it breaches Principle 4 by failing to maintain clear distinction between user opinion, speculation, and factual information. The summary section in particular presents interpretations and characterizations as factual findings. The document should be clearly labeled as social media commentary with disclaimers about verification. If these are simply screenshots of user comments, then NZMC principles apply less directly, but editorial framing still matters.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification Issues:**
The document is not clearly identified as to its nature:
- Not labeled as "Social Media Comments," "Community Discussion," or "Reader Reactions"
- No clear indication this is user-generated content vs. editorial compilation
- Summary section (lines 130-146) appears editorial but lacks byline or clear attribution
- Document title "Facebook Comments on QLDC Consultant Spending" suggests compilation, but no editorial statement explains curation process

**Foundation of Fact:**
Even treating this as opinion content, factual foundation is weak:
- Claims about consultant spending patterns ($400-500k range) not verified with data
- References to specific QLDC statements (invoice checking, timesheet review) not sourced
- "Potential conflicts of interest" mentioned without establishing factual basis
- No verification that consultant spending is excessive or problematic

**User Content vs. Editorial:**
If these are Letters to Editor or user submissions:
- Principle 5 states "Letters for publication are the prerogative of editors who are to be guided by fairness, balance and public interest"
- Editor selection of entirely critical comments without balancing views could breach fairness requirement
- Allowing profanity and inflammatory language ("fuckers," "clown car...skip fire filled with used diapers") raises questions about editorial judgment

**Balance Requirement:**
Principle 5 notes "with comment and opinion balance is not essential." However:
- This applies to clearly identified opinion columns, not curated public comments
- If presenting "community views," balance is essential to avoid misleading readers
- Selective presentation of only critical voices could misrepresent actual community sentiment

**Evidence:**

No header or label identifies this as: "Social Media Compilation," "Community Reactions," "Facebook Discussion Thread," or similar designation that would signal nature of content.

Summary section (lines 130-146) lacks byline, date, or attribution indicating whether this is:
- Crux editorial analysis
- Automated compilation
- Third-party summary
- User-generated content

Editorial note states: "This appears to be a discussion thread related to QLDC's consultant spending, likely in response to a Crux article" (lines 144-145) - The uncertain framing ("appears," "likely") suggests even the compiler is unclear about context, yet presents serious allegations.

**Findings:**
The document lacks clear identification of its nature and purpose. If Crux compiled these comments, it should be clearly labeled as user-generated content with appropriate disclaimers. The summary section appears editorial but lacks proper attribution and foundation. If treated as Letters to Editor, the selection appears to violate fairness guidance by excluding balancing perspectives. The document occupies unclear territory between user content and editorial presentation, creating confusion about applicability of NZMC principles.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Not Applicable / Informational Only

**Analysis:**

The document has a descriptive title "Facebook Comments on QLDC Consultant Spending" which accurately describes the content - it is indeed Facebook comments about QLDC consultant spending.

**Accuracy Assessment:**
The title is factually accurate and does not mislead. It clearly indicates:
1. These are Facebook comments (not editorial content)
2. Topic is QLDC consultant spending
3. It's a compilation or collection

**No Misleading Elements:**
Unlike a news headline, this appears to be a file or document title that descriptively labels the content. There are no sub-headings or captions that could mislead.

**Community Discussion Thread:**
The subtitle "Community Discussion Thread" (line 3) is also accurate and helpful in identifying the nature of content.

**Evidence:**

Title: "# Facebook Comments on QLDC Consultant Spending" (line 1) - Accurate descriptor of content.

Subtitle: "## Community Discussion Thread" (line 3) - Properly identifies this as community discussion, not editorial.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 6. The title and subtitle accurately convey the nature of the content. However, this informational accuracy makes the lack of other clear labeling (per Principle 5) more notable - if the title correctly identifies this as Facebook comments, why is the summary section presented without clear attribution or disclaimers?

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Electoral Context:**
Per ReviewContext.MD, Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections are underway. Several comments have direct electoral implications:
- Susan Manson: "#CEOneedstogo" (line 112) - Direct call for CEO dismissal during election
- Comments criticizing QLDC leadership and management could influence voter perceptions
- Discussion of consultant spending is relevant campaign issue

**Crux's Interest:**
The document reveals potential conflicts:
1. **Leeann Morton**: "Thank you Crux for following these up." (line 123) with "6 👍" reactions (line 126) - This shows community support for Crux's advocacy position
2. **Advocacy Role**: Historical NZMC complaints show Crux describes itself as doing "advocacy journalism" and being "consistently opinionated in favour of the community"
3. **Financial Interest**: Community support and engagement with Crux's QLDC criticism benefits Crux's readership and influence

**Disclosure Requirements:**
If Crux compiled this document:
- Should disclose that comments are curated from Crux's own Facebook page
- Should note that supportive comments about Crux were included
- Should acknowledge electoral context for leadership criticism
- Should disclose any relationship between commenters and Crux (e.g., if James Porteous is regular contributor/supporter)

**Presentation Bias:**
The inclusion of Leeann Morton's thank you to Crux (lines 123-126) in a compilation about consultant spending creates appearance of:
- Self-promotion (highlighting praise of Crux)
- Confirmation bias (selecting comments that validate Crux's coverage)
- Advocacy over journalism (presenting supporters as representative community voice)

**Evidence:**

Leeann Morton: "Thank you Crux for following these up." (line 123) - Included in compilation despite not addressing consultant spending substantively, suggesting inclusion criteria favored Crux-supportive comments.

Morton identified with "Top Fan Badge" (line 120) - This indicates she's a regular Crux supporter, which should be disclosed if presenting her views as representative community sentiment.

Summary section: "Support for Crux: Community appreciation for Crux's investigative reporting on these issues." (lines 140-141) - Crux's editorial summary highlights support for itself without noting potential bias in comment selection.

**Findings:**
If Crux compiled this document, potential conflict of interest exists in:
1. Curating comments from its own platform without disclosure
2. Including self-congratulatory comments without noting selection bias
3. Publishing during election period without disclosing electoral context
4. Using community comments to validate its own advocacy position

The lack of disclosure about the compilation source, selection criteria, and Crux's interest in the discussion constitutes potential breach of Principle 10. At minimum, disclosure should note: "Comments selected from Crux Facebook discussion" and acknowledge that selection may reflect editorial perspective.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Public vs. Private Comments:**
While Facebook comments are typically public, several privacy considerations arise:

1. **Commenter Identification**: Full names are provided (James Porteous, Andrew Patchett, Jay Moore, Edward Coad, Olly Black, Rickard Robl, Jessica Hinsen, Nathan Katene, Susan Manson, Leeann Morton)

2. **Context Change**: Comments made on Facebook have different context than being compiled into document presented as representative community views

3. **Republication**: Taking comments from one platform (Facebook) and republishing in another format (this document) changes context and potentially amplifies reach

**Privacy vs. Public Interest:**
- Discussion of QLDC spending is clearly public interest matter
- Comments about public officials (CEO, council) don't raise privacy concerns
- However, individual citizens' social media comments may not have been intended for broader republication

**Special Concerns:**
- Nathan Katene's profane comment (line 101) with full name attached
- Tag comments by Jessica Hinsen mentioning "Aaron Waldron" (lines 83, 92) - person tagged who may not have consented to inclusion
- Identification of Leeann Morton with "Top Fan Badge" (line 120) - highlights her relationship to Crux

**Consent Considerations:**
- No indication commenters consented to compilation/republication
- Facebook's public nature doesn't automatically grant republication rights for all purposes
- Compilation changes nature from individual comments to curated document

**Evidence:**

Nathan Katene: "David Powell fuckers" (line 101) - Full name attached to profanity in republished format, potentially more damaging than original Facebook context.

Jessica Hinsen tags "Aaron Waldron" (lines 83, 92) - Third party mentioned without indication of consent for inclusion in compiled document.

Leeann Morton: "Top Fan Badge" (line 120) - Status information from Facebook profile republished, potentially revealing information about her social media habits.

**Findings:**
Potential privacy breach depends on:
1. Whether commenters consented to republication
2. Facebook's terms regarding content reuse
3. Whether compilation materially changes context or impact

While comments on public officials generally don't raise privacy issues, the republication of individual citizens' social media comments with full names in a compiled document changes context. Best practice would include:
- Seeking consent or anonymizing names
- Clear attribution that these are Facebook comments
- Respecting original context and platform

The inclusion of profanity and tag mentions alongside full names raises particular concerns. This could constitute privacy breach if commenters didn't anticipate or consent to this form of republication.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The comments do not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical or mental disability. The discussion focuses on QLDC governance, consultant spending, and public accountability.

No commenter characteristics are gratuitously emphasized. While names suggest diverse backgrounds, no discriminatory language or emphasis appears.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this content.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The content does not involve confidential sources. All comments are from identified individuals on public Facebook platform.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

No indication of subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means in obtaining the comments. They appear to be publicly available Facebook comments.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No photographs or graphics are included in the provided text.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: If Crux compiled and curated these comments, the entirely critical selection without balancing perspectives or QLDC response could constitute unfairness. The editorial summary presents one-sided interpretations without proper factual foundation or balance. The selection appears designed to validate Crux's critical stance toward QLDC rather than fairly represent community views.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The document fails to clearly distinguish between user opinion, speculation, and factual information. The summary section presents interpretations as factual findings. Claims about spending patterns, accountability failures, and "potential conflicts of interest" are stated without proper verification or qualification as opinion.

3. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The document lacks clear identification of its nature, purpose, and compilation criteria. If these are selected user comments (analogous to Letters to Editor), the selection violates fairness guidance by excluding balancing perspectives. The summary section lacks proper attribution.

4. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: If Crux compiled this document from its own Facebook page, it fails to disclose this source and its interest in validating its advocacy position. The inclusion of self-congratulatory comments without noting selection bias, and publication during election period without disclosing electoral context, constitutes inadequate disclosure.

5. **Principle 2 (Privacy) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: Republication of individual citizens' Facebook comments with full names in compiled document format changes context and potentially amplifies reach beyond commenters' reasonable expectations. Inclusion of profanity and third-party tag mentions alongside full names raises particular concerns.

**Compliant Principles:**
- Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - Title accurately describes content
- Principle 7 (Discrimination and Diversity) - No discriminatory content
- Principles 3, 8, 9, 11 - Not applicable

---

**Critical Distinction:**

The assessment above applies **IF Crux compiled, curated, or published this content as editorial material**. If this document is:
- Simple screenshot archive of Facebook comments
- User-compiled collection
- Third-party documentation

Then NZMC principles have limited or no application, as they apply to published editorial content, not user-generated social media comments.

**However**, several factors suggest Crux editorial involvement:
1. Professional summary section (lines 130-146)
2. Organized thematic analysis
3. Editorial note about article context (lines 144-146)
4. Inclusion of self-congratulatory Crux comment

If Crux's role was limited to hosting the original Facebook discussion, standards apply to:
- Moderation policies (allowing profanity, inflammatory language)
- Platform responsibility for content that remains published
- Any editorial framing or sharing of the comments

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This document, if Crux-compiled, shows patterns consistent with historical NZMC findings:

1. **Blurring Fact and Opinion** (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940): Summary section presents opinions as factual findings, consistent with pattern of "opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news"

2. **Lack of Balance** (Cases 2891, 2940): Entirely critical comment selection without opposing views, consistent with pattern of "failing to include known information that would provide balance"

3. **Advocacy Over Standards** (All cases): Document appears designed to validate Crux's advocacy position rather than fairly inform, consistent with pattern where Crux claims "advocacy journalism" as defense while Media Council maintains ethical standards still apply

4. **Relationship with QLDC** (Case 2940): Continued antagonistic framing of QLDC, consistent with Media Council's finding of "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism marked by stonewalling and hostile email exchanges"

5. **Self-Promotion** (New pattern): Including self-congratulatory comments in compilation appears to be new element, suggesting evolution of advocacy approach

If this pattern extends to regular curation of social media comments to validate editorial positions, it represents concerning development in Crux's approach that Media Council has not yet addressed.

---

**Electoral Context:**

The electoral timing has critical implications:

1. **Campaign Influence**: Comments calling for CEO dismissal (#CEOneedstogo) and criticizing QLDC leadership during election period could influence voters, particularly if presented as representative community sentiment

2. **Unfair Advantage**: If Crux curated only critical comments while excluding balanced views, this creates unfair electoral advantage for candidates running on anti-QLDC platforms

3. **Voter Information**: Voters exposed to this compilation may believe community is unanimously critical of QLDC, when reality may be more balanced (note: Olly Black and Jay Moore actually express moderate views that consultant fees aren't excessive)

4. **Platform Responsibility**: During elections, media platforms have heightened responsibility to ensure fair presentation of views and avoid partisan curation that could affect outcomes

5. **Democratic Function**: NZMC preamble states "An independent press plays a vital role in a democracy" - curating one-sided social media commentary during elections fails this democratic function

The electoral context transforms potential breaches from standard fairness issues into matters affecting democratic integrity and informed voter choice.

---

## Recommendations

**Immediate Clarification Needed:**

Before determining whether formal complaint is warranted, clarify:

1. **Source**: Is this Crux-compiled document or third-party collection?
2. **Publication Status**: Was this published by Crux as editorial content or is it archive/documentation?
3. **Selection Criteria**: If Crux-compiled, what criteria determined which comments to include/exclude?
4. **Context**: What was the original Crux article that generated these comments?
5. **Consent**: Did commenters consent to republication in this format?

**If Crux Published This Content:**

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are grounds for formal complaint to NZMC citing:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: Curated selection fails to give fair voice to opposing views. Specific grounds:
   - Only critical comments selected, excluding balanced perspectives
   - Summary section presents one-sided interpretations as factual findings
   - No QLDC response or balancing information provided
   - Electoral period publication without balance could influence voters unfairly

2. **Principle 5 - Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**: Document not clearly identified. Specific grounds:
   - No clear labeling as "Social Media Compilation" or "Reader Comments"
   - Summary section lacks attribution or byline
   - If treated as Letters to Editor, selection violates fairness requirement
   - No disclosure of curation criteria or editorial involvement

3. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: Inadequate disclosure. Specific grounds:
   - No disclosure if compiled from Crux's own Facebook page
   - Inclusion of self-congratulatory comments without noting selection bias
   - No disclosure of electoral context or timing implications
   - Failure to note Crux's advocacy interest in validating its QLDC criticism

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: Failure to distinguish opinion from fact in summary section and editorial framing

5. **Principle 2 - Privacy**: Republication of social media comments with full names without apparent consent, changing context and amplifying reach

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Lack of Balance - One-Sided Selection:**
   - No comments defending QLDC management or explaining consultant necessity
   - Exclusion of moderate voices (note: Olly Black's "It doesnt seem that bad" and Jay Moore's "$448k...doesn't seem like much" are minority views)
   - Summary: "Multiple commenters express frustration" (line 132) without noting absence of counter-perspectives

2. **Inadequate Identification:**
   - No clear label as "Social Media Comments," "Community Reactions," or "User-Generated Content"
   - Summary section (lines 130-146) appears editorial but lacks byline or attribution
   - Final note about "potential conflicts of interest" (line 146) presented without clarifying this is interpretation

3. **Conflict of Interest - Self-Promotion:**
   - Leeann Morton: "Thank you Crux for following these up" (line 123) included in compilation
   - Summary: "Support for Crux: Community appreciation for Crux's investigative reporting" (lines 140-141)
   - No disclosure that comments selected from Crux's own platform
   - Morton's "Top Fan Badge" (line 120) indicates partisan relationship

4. **Electoral Context - Undisclosed Timing:**
   - Susan Manson: "#CEOneedstogo" (line 112) - call for CEO dismissal during election
   - No disclosure this is published during electoral period
   - No balancing information about QLDC management performance
   - Could influence voter perceptions without balanced context

5. **Opinion as Fact in Summary:**
   - "Lack of Accountability" (line 132) stated as fact rather than commenter perception
   - "Rate Impact: Concern that rates are primarily funding consultants" (lines 135-136) presents opinion as factual finding
   - "Potential conflicts of interest" (line 146) - serious allegation without factual basis

---

**Required Actions per NZMC Procedure:**

**Step 1 - Determine Complaint Standing:**
- Clarify if this content was published by Crux as editorial material
- If yes, determine appropriate complainant (affected QLDC official, CEO, or community member concerned about electoral fairness)
- Note: NZMC considers third-party complaints but may require consent from affected individuals

**Step 2 - Complaint to Publisher (Crux):**
- **Timing**: Must be within one calendar month of first publication
- **Method**: Written complaint clearly marked as complaint to publisher
- **Content**: Should cite specific principle breaches and request:
  - Disclosure of compilation source and selection criteria
  - Clear labeling as social media compilation vs. editorial content
  - Balance through publication of opposing community views
  - Correction to summary section removing unverified claims
  - Disclosure of electoral context and timing
  - Correction acknowledging selection bias if applicable

**Step 3 - Escalation to NZMC (if necessary):**
- **Timing**: If no response within 10 working days, or if response is unsatisfactory
- **Deadline**: Within 20 working days of publisher's response
- **Requirements**:
  - State principles breached (Principles 1, 5, 10, and potentially 2 and 4)
  - Provide document copy and evidence of publication
  - Include initial complaint to publisher and their response
  - Provide key points in 500 words
  - Sign waiver regarding no other formal action

**Step 4 - Supporting Documentation to Gather:**
- Original Facebook post/article that generated comments
- Complete comment thread showing any excluded balancing comments
- Evidence of publication date and format
- Documentation of electoral period timing
- Any Crux editorial guidelines for social media curation
- Evidence of whether QLDC or other perspectives were offered platform

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Disclosure Ruling**: Direct Crux to clearly disclose when curating social media comments:
   - Source (from Crux's own platform)
   - Selection criteria
   - Editorial involvement vs. automated compilation
   - Any conflicts of interest

2. **Labeling Requirement**: Require clear labeling of:
   - Social media compilations as user-generated content
   - Editorial summaries with proper attribution
   - Electoral context when publishing during campaigns

3. **Balance Correction**: Request publication of:
   - Balancing community perspectives on consultant spending
   - QLDC response to accountability concerns
   - Correction acknowledging selection bias if present

4. **Privacy Protection**: Direct Crux to establish policies for:
   - Consent before republishing social media comments
   - Anonymization options for commenters
   - Respecting original platform context

5. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Standard NZMC remedy - publish summary of decision with fair prominence and note on electronic copy

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Threshold Issue**: First determine if this content meets threshold for NZMC jurisdiction - was it "published material" in newspapers, magazines, websites, or digital sites with news content? If it's purely social media comments on Facebook, jurisdiction may be limited.

2. **Precedent Value**: This could establish important precedent regarding:
   - Media responsibility for curating social media comments
   - Disclosure requirements when selecting user content
   - Platform duties during electoral periods
   - Standards for presenting community sentiment

3. **Public Interest**: Complaint serves public interest by:
   - Ensuring fair representation of community views
   - Protecting electoral integrity from partisan curation
   - Establishing transparency in social media content selection
   - Maintaining distinction between user content and editorial endorsement

4. **Pattern Evidence**: Investigate whether:
   - Crux regularly curates comments to validate editorial positions
   - This is part of broader pattern of advocacy over standards
   - Other social media compilations show similar selection bias
   - Historical NZMC findings about balance failures extend to social media curation

5. **Alternative Resolution**: Consider requesting:
   - Crux publish clear social media curation policy
   - Disclosure statements on curated content
   - Balance commitment for electoral period
   - Rather than formal complaint process

6. **Timing Sensitivity**: If pursuing complaint:
   - Act quickly due to one-month deadline from publication
   - Consider electoral timeline - is complaint time-sensitive for voter information?
   - Weigh whether public interest served by immediate informal resolution vs. formal process

- Document: "Facebook Comments on QLDC Consultant Spending" (approximately 2022, 3 years ago based on comment timestamps)
- ReviewContext.MD (Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections underway, Crux history)
- Historical NZMC Complaints Against Crux (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940, 3012, 3356 - 60% upheld)

**Relevant NZMC Principles:**
- Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
- Principle 2: Privacy
- Principle 4: Comment and Fact
- Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
- Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest

**Key Context:**
- Electoral period: Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections underway
- Historical pattern: Crux upheld for breaches in 60% of NZMC cases (2020-2022)
- Relationship: Media Council previously found "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" between Crux and QLDC entities
- Repeat issues: Failure to distinguish fact from opinion, inadequate balance, lack of right of reply

**Critical Uncertainty:**
- **Publication Status**: Unclear if this is Crux-published editorial content or third-party documentation
- **Date**: Comments noted as "3y" ago (approximately 2022), but compilation date unknown
- **Original Article**: Reference to Crux article about consultant spending, possibly Case 3356 (Andrew Tipene $448k article from August 2022)

**Review Methodology:**

This review was conducted by:
1. Close reading of the document (147 lines including comments and summary)
2. Analysis against all relevant NZMC Statement of Principles
3. Review of historical NZMC complaints against Crux for pattern context
4. Consideration of electoral timing and public interest implications
5. Assessment of distinction between user content and editorial responsibility
6. Development of conditional recommendations based on publication status

**Objectivity and Limitations:**

This review strives to be objective and evidence-based. However, reviewers should note:
- Analysis assumes Crux compiled/published this content; if not, conclusions change materially
- Publication date uncertain (comments 3 years old, compilation date unknown)
- Cannot verify if this represents complete comment thread or selective compilation
- Original article context not available for review
- Some assessments depend on interpretation of editorial vs. user content boundaries

**Key Principles Applied in This Review:**

1. **Evidence-Based**: All findings cite specific content from document
2. **Conditional**: Distinguishes between findings if Crux-published vs. third-party content
3. **Contextual**: Considers electoral timing, historical patterns, and platform responsibilities
4. **Proportionate**: Distinguishes between clear breaches, potential breaches, and compliant content
5. **Practical**: Provides actionable recommendations contingent on threshold determinations

**Conclusion:**

This document presents significant NZMC compliance concerns **if it represents Crux-compiled editorial content**. The combination of:
- One-sided comment selection without balance
- Editorial summary presenting opinions as facts
- Inadequate disclosure of source and conflicts of interest
- Electoral period publication without context
- Privacy concerns from republication of social media comments

Would constitute multiple potential breaches of NZMC principles.

However, the critical threshold question is whether this content was published by Crux as editorial material or represents third-party documentation of social media discussion. NZMC principles apply primarily to published editorial content, not user-generated social media comments per se.

If Crux published this as curated compilation, it represents concerning evolution of the patterns identified in historical complaints - using social media curation to validate advocacy positions while avoiding traditional editorial responsibilities for balance and fairness.

**Before proceeding with formal complaint, clarification is essential regarding:**
1. Publication status and format
2. Crux's role in compilation and curation
3. Original article context
4. Publication/compilation date

These determinations will dictate whether formal complaint is warranted and, if so, which principles are most clearly breached.

The potential precedent value is significant - this could establish important standards for how media organizations curate and present social media content, particularly during electoral periods. The line between hosting user discussions and editorially endorsing perspectives through selective curation is critical to democratic function and journalistic integrity.
