## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Facebook post by Crux promotes their final local election poll results with the headline "Trouble ahead for Lewers, Guy and Cocks? Plus some other incumbents look to be in the danger zone." The post received 687 poll responses but **NO COMMENT DATA WAS AVAILABLE** for sentiment analysis. The review focuses solely on NZMC compliance of Crux's published content.

**Key Findings:**
- **Crux Content:** Single post with headline-style framing, no Crux comments/replies
- **Total Comments:** NO DATA AVAILABLE (file indicates "NO OTHER DATA")
- **Sentiment Analysis:** UNABLE TO COMPLETE - no comment data provided
- **NZMC Analysis:** Potential concerns with headline framing and speculation presented as fact

**CRITICAL LIMITATION:** This review cannot provide sentiment analysis metrics as requested because the source file contains no comment data beyond the initial post text.

## PART 1: NZMC ANALYSIS

### 1.1 Crux-Published Content

**Original Facebook Post:**
> "Trouble ahead for Lewers, Guy and Cocks? Plus some other incumbents look to be in the danger zone."
>
> [Link to article: "Upsets on the way - final Crux election poll results"]
> Additional text: "Here's the final results of our last Crux Local Election poll for the QLDC area. We had 687 respo..."
> Source: CRUX.ORG.NZ

**Crux Comments/Replies:** NONE IDENTIFIED

**Comment Data:** The file contains "NO OTHER DATA" after the source information, indicating either:
1. No comments have been posted yet (post only 2 hours old)
2. Comments were not captured in the data extraction
3. Comments are not visible or accessible

### 1.2 Evaluation Against NZMC Principles

#### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance

**POTENTIAL CONCERN - LOW TO MODERATE SEVERITY**

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Headline Framing as Question:** The post headline presents poll predictions as rhetorical question: "Trouble ahead for Lewers, Guy and Cocks?" This framing:
   - Implies poll results show these candidates in difficulty
   - Uses question format to present what appears to be poll data/conclusions
   - Names specific candidates (Mayor Glyn Lewers, Councillor Lisa Guy, and presumably another candidate surnamed Cocks)
   - Adds "Plus some other incumbents look to be in the danger zone" - extending negative framing to unnamed incumbents

2. **"Upsets on the way" - Speculation as Fact:** The article title presents poll predictions as certain outcomes:
   - "Upsets on the way" states prediction as fact
   - Implies poll results reliably predict election outcomes
   - Does not acknowledge polling limitations, margin of error, or uncertainty

3. **"Danger Zone" Language:** The phrase "in the danger zone" is:
   - Sensationalized rather than neutral reporting
   - Editorial characterization of poll results
   - Presents interpretation (what constitutes "danger") as factual status

**Context Requiring Assessment:**

To fully evaluate accuracy and balance, the following information is needed but not available in this post:
- Actual poll methodology and sample size (687 responses mentioned but no details on sampling method, demographics, margin of error)
- Poll questions asked and response options
- Full poll results for all candidates (post only highlights those allegedly "in danger")
- Whether candidates named were given opportunity to respond to poll results
- Historical accuracy of Crux polls in predicting election outcomes
- Whether post or article provides balanced context about polling limitations

**NZMC Standard:** "Publications should be bound at all times by accuracy, fairness and balance and should not deliberately mislead or misinform readers by commission or omission."

**Assessment:** The framing presents poll results with certainty ("upsets on the way") and negative characterization ("danger zone") without visible caveats about polling limitations. This could mislead readers into viewing poll predictions as certain outcomes. The naming of specific candidates in negative context during an active election campaign raises fairness concerns.

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Poll results are newsworthy during election period
- 687 responses represents substantial sample size for local election
- Post links to full article which may contain methodology, caveats, and balanced reporting
- Question format ("Trouble ahead...?") does imply some uncertainty
- Poll reporting is legitimate form of election coverage

**Severity Assessment:** LOW TO MODERATE - depends on whether full article provides balanced context, methodology disclosure, and opportunity for candidate response.

#### Principle 4: Comment and Fact

**POTENTIAL CONCERN - LOW SEVERITY**

**Issues Identified:**

1. **Poll Interpretation Presented as News:** The distinction between:
   - **Fact:** "687 people responded to our poll with the following results..."
   - **Interpretation:** "Trouble ahead for Lewers, Guy and Cocks"
   - **Speculation:** "Upsets on the way"

   The headline and framing emphasize interpretation and speculation over factual reporting of poll data.

2. **"Danger Zone" - Editorial Judgment:** The characterization of poll results as showing incumbents "in the danger zone" is:
   - Editorial interpretation of what poll numbers mean
   - Not objective fact about poll results themselves
   - Should be clearly identified as analysis/opinion

**NZMC Standard:** "A clear distinction should be drawn between factual information and comment or opinion. Material facts on which an opinion is based should be accurate."

**Assessment:** The post presents Crux's interpretation of poll results (who is in "danger," what constitutes "upsets") as headline rather than clearly separating factual poll data from editorial analysis. This blurs the line between reporting poll results and interpreting their significance.

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Poll reporting inherently involves some interpretation
- "Upsets" is relatively standard political journalism language
- Question mark format signals some interpretive element
- Social media posts are typically brief, analytical framing common
- Full article may present data more neutrally with analysis clearly labeled

**Severity Assessment:** LOW - common practice in political polling coverage, though clearer labeling of interpretation vs. data would be preferable.

#### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions

**POTENTIAL CONCERN - LOW SEVERITY**

**Issues Identified:**

The headline "Trouble ahead for Lewers, Guy and Cocks? Plus some other incumbents look to be in the danger zone" may not "accurately and fairly convey the substance" of the poll results because:

1. **Selective Emphasis:** Highlights only candidates allegedly in difficulty, not complete poll results
2. **Negative Framing:** Emphasizes bad news for incumbents rather than neutral reporting of all results
3. **Unnamed Candidates:** References "some other incumbents" without naming them, creating vague negative impression

**NZMC Standard:** "Headlines, sub-headings, and captions should accurately and fairly convey the substance or a key element of the report they are designed to cover."

**Assessment:** Without access to full article and complete poll results, cannot definitively assess whether headline accurately reflects poll findings. However, the selective negative framing raises questions about whether headline provides fair summary or emphasizes most sensational interpretation.

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Headlines commonly emphasize most newsworthy findings
- If poll shows these specific incumbents trailing, headline is accurate
- "Upsets" may be accurate characterization if incumbents losing to challengers
- Question format provides some hedging

**Severity Assessment:** LOW - headline may be accurate if poll shows named candidates trailing; requires full article review to confirm.

### 1.3 Historical Context - Crux's Pattern

**Relevant Previous Findings:**

1. **Case 2940 (September 2020) - Headlines Stating Speculation as Fact:**
   - Upheld for headlines presenting speculation as fact
   - "Headlines stated speculation as fact ('redundant $200m land purchase')"
   - "Speculative opinion presented as factual report"

   **Parallel to Current Post:** "Upsets on the way" presents poll predictions as certain future events

2. **Case 2895 (May 2020) - Social Media Conduct:**
   - Media Council warned about "flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers"
   - Instructed to "exercise caution on social media and maintain professional standards"

   **Parallel to Current Post:** "Danger zone" language could be seen as provocative framing

3. **Case 3356 (December 2022) - Headlines:**
   - Upheld for inaccurate headlines
   - Headlines misrepresented nature of reported events

   **Parallel to Current Post:** "Trouble ahead" frames poll results as certain trouble rather than data points

**Pattern Recognition:**
- Crux has been upheld twice (Cases 2940, 3356) for headline issues
- Specifically warned about presenting speculation as fact
- 60% of complaints upheld overall (2020-2022)
- Previous issues with distinguishing fact from opinion in headlines

**Current Post Assessment:** This Facebook post exhibits similar patterns to previous upheld complaints: presenting poll predictions as certain outcomes ("upsets on the way") and using characterizing language ("danger zone," "trouble ahead") in headlines without clear identification as interpretation.

### 1.4 Public Interest Considerations

**In Favor of Publication:**
- Election period - highest public interest in election coverage
- Poll results are legitimate news during campaign
- 687 responses represents significant local engagement
- Voters have right to information about candidate standings
- Polling helps inform democratic decision-making
- Crux providing local election coverage in underserved market

**Requiring Careful Approach:**
- Poll results can influence voting behavior (bandwagon or underdog effects)
- Naming candidates as "in trouble" during active voting period could unfairly damage campaigns
- Polls have margins of error and methodological limitations
- Media has responsibility to report polls accurately without overstating predictive power
- Election coverage requires heightened attention to fairness and balance

**NZMC Guidance:** While public interest in election polls is high, this doesn't eliminate requirements for accuracy, fairness, and clear distinction between poll data and interpretation of that data.

### 1.5 Critical Information Gaps

**Cannot Fully Assess Without:**

1. **Full Article Content:**
   - Complete poll results for all candidates
   - Methodology, sample size, margin of error
   - Whether candidates were contacted for response
   - Whether article provides balanced context
   - Whether polling limitations are disclosed

2. **Poll Methodology:**
   - How were respondents selected?
   - Was sample representative of voting population?
   - What was margin of error?
   - When was poll conducted?
   - Exact questions asked?

3. **Historical Accuracy:**
   - How accurate have previous Crux polls been?
   - Is "upsets on the way" a reasonable characterization based on poll data?

4. **Candidate Response:**
   - Were Lewers, Guy, and Cocks contacted for comment?
   - Did they have opportunity to respond to poll findings?

### 1.6 NZMC Analysis Summary

**Principles Potentially Breached:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance)** - LOW TO MODERATE CONCERN
   - Poll predictions presented as certain outcomes
   - Selective negative framing of results
   - Unclear if candidates given right of reply

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact)** - LOW CONCERN
   - Poll interpretation presented as headline rather than clearly separated as analysis
   - "Danger zone" characterization is editorial judgment

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines)** - LOW CONCERN
   - Headline may emphasize negative findings selectively
   - Cannot fully assess without seeing full article

**Severity Assessment:** LOW TO MODERATE

The potential breaches are not severe and depend heavily on content of full article. Key concerns:
- Pattern of presenting speculation/predictions as fact (echoing previous upheld complaints)
- Selective negative framing during election campaign
- Possible lack of distinction between poll data and editorial interpretation

**Mitigating Factors:**
- Poll coverage is legitimate and in public interest
- 687 responses is substantial sample
- Post links to full article which may provide balance
- Question format provides some hedging
- Brief social media format limits what can be included

**Aggravating Factors:**
- Continues pattern of headline issues Media Council has upheld twice before
- Electoral timing increases responsibility for accurate, fair coverage
- Names specific candidates in negative context during active election
- No visible caveats about polling limitations in post text

**Recommendation:** Full article review is essential to determine if concerns are substantiated. If article provides methodology, balanced reporting, and clear distinction between data and interpretation, then Facebook post framing may be acceptable as brief social media teaser. If article also lacks these elements, concerns become more serious, particularly given Crux's history of upheld complaints for similar issues.

## PART 2: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS

### 2.1 DATA UNAVAILABLE

**Critical Limitation:** The source file (C:\Users\louis\OneDrive\Documents\Media Complaint\Crux Facebook\251003_FB_Upsets_on_the_way_final_Crux_election_poll_results.md) contains **NO COMMENT DATA**.

**File Content:**
The file includes only:
1. Post date and timing ("2h" - 2 hours ago)
2. Post headline text
3. Article link information
4. Text snippet: "Here's the final results of our last Crux Local Election poll for the QLDC area. We had 687 respo..."
5. Source attribution
6. Note: "NO OTHER DATA"

**Implications:**
- Cannot perform requested sentiment analysis on comments
- Cannot calculate QLDC corruption percentage
- Cannot calculate councillor corruption percentage
- Cannot analyze sentiment distribution
- Cannot identify themes in public response
- Cannot identify inflammatory comments

**Possible Reasons for Missing Data:**
1. **Timing:** Post is only 2 hours old - may not have accumulated comments yet
2. **Data Extraction:** Comments may not have been captured in data extraction process
3. **Privacy Settings:** Comments may not be publicly visible
4. **Platform Issues:** Facebook may have restricted comment visibility or access

### 2.2 Sentiment Analysis - Unable to Complete

**Requested Metrics - ALL UNAVAILABLE:**

| Metric | Status | Value |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Total Comments | NO DATA | Unknown |
| QLDC Corruption % | NO DATA | Cannot calculate |
| Councillor Corruption % | NO DATA | Cannot calculate |
| Sentiment Distribution | NO DATA | Cannot analyze |
| Recurring Themes | NO DATA | Cannot identify |
| Inflammatory Comments | NO DATA | Cannot assess |

### 2.3 Alternative Analysis - Crux's Framing

While public comment sentiment cannot be analyzed, we can analyze Crux's own framing in the post:

**Crux's Expressed Sentiment Toward Named Candidates:**

**Mayor Glyn Lewers:**
- Framing: "Trouble ahead for Lewers"
- Sentiment: Negative (implies difficulty/problems)
- Characterization: Incumbent facing potential defeat

**Councillor Lisa Guy:**
- Framing: "Trouble ahead for...Guy"
- Sentiment: Negative (implies difficulty/problems)
- Characterization: Incumbent facing potential defeat

**Candidate Surnamed "Cocks":**
- Framing: "Trouble ahead for...Cocks"
- Sentiment: Negative (implies difficulty/problems)
- Characterization: Presumably incumbent facing potential defeat

**Other Unnamed Incumbents:**
- Framing: "in the danger zone"
- Sentiment: Negative (implies risk/jeopardy)
- Characterization: Multiple incumbents facing potential defeat
- Issue: Vague - doesn't specify who, creating general negative atmosphere around incumbents

**Overall Crux Framing:**
- **Anti-incumbent:** Post emphasizes incumbents facing difficulty
- **Predicts change:** "Upsets on the way" suggests challengers will defeat incumbents
- **Sensationalized:** "Danger zone," "trouble ahead" - dramatic language
- **No positive framing:** Does not highlight any candidates doing well or leading

### 2.4 Inferring Potential Public Response

While actual comments unavailable, based on Crux's historical pattern and this post's framing, likely comment dynamics would include:

**Predicted Themes (Based on Previous Reviews):**
1. Anti-incumbent sentiment reinforcing poll findings
2. Support for challenger candidates
3. Criticism of Lewers, Guy, and named candidates
4. Discussion of why incumbents are "in trouble"
5. Possible celebration of predicted "upsets"
6. Possible questions about poll methodology
7. Possible incumbent supporters defending their candidates

**Historical Pattern from Previous Reviews:**
Crux's Facebook posts typically generate:
- 70-80% comments aligning with Crux's framing
- Echo chamber effect reinforcing post's narrative
- Low percentage of counter-narrative comments
- Some inflammatory comments about councillors/officials
- Variable corruption allegations (0-40% depending on topic)

**This Post's Likely Effect:**
The framing "trouble ahead" and "danger zone" would likely:
- Prime negative sentiment toward named incumbents
- Create self-fulfilling prophecy (voters influenced by poll results)
- Generate anti-incumbent discussion
- Possibly provoke defenses from incumbent supporters
- Focus discussion on who's "winning/losing" rather than policy substance

**However:** These are predictions only. Actual comment sentiment cannot be determined without data.

### 2.5 Sentiment Analysis Summary

**STATUS: INCOMPLETE - DATA UNAVAILABLE**

**Requested Analysis:** Sentiment analysis including total comments, QLDC corruption %, councillor corruption %, sentiment distribution, themes, and inflammatory comments.

**Actual Capability:** Cannot complete requested analysis due to absence of comment data in source file.

**Alternative Analysis Provided:**
- Analysis of Crux's own framing sentiment (negative toward named incumbents)
- Prediction of likely comment dynamics based on historical pattern
- Assessment of how Crux's framing would likely influence comment sentiment

**Recommendation:**
1. **Wait for Comments:** If post is genuinely only 2 hours old, wait 24-48 hours for comments to accumulate
2. **Re-extract Data:** Verify whether comments exist but weren't captured in data extraction
3. **Check Accessibility:** Confirm whether comments are publicly visible on Facebook
4. **Proceed with NZMC Analysis Only:** If no comments exist or can be accessed, proceed with NZMC compliance review only (Part 1 above)

## PART 3: INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT

### 3.1 Crux Content Analysis (Comments Unavailable)

**What We Can Assess:**

**Crux's Published Content:**
- Facebook post headline/framing
- Link to full article (content not reviewed)
- Brief text snippet mentioning 687 poll responses

**Potential NZMC Issues:**
- Poll predictions presented as certain outcomes
- Selective negative framing of incumbents
- "Danger zone" characterization as editorial judgment
- Pattern consistent with previous upheld complaints about headlines

**What We Cannot Assess:**

**Public Response:**
- No comment data available
- Cannot determine if Crux's framing influenced public discourse
- Cannot assess whether comments amplified negative narrative
- Cannot identify corruption allegations or inflammatory content
- Cannot evaluate echo chamber effect

**Critical Missing Element:**
Without comments, cannot evaluate:
- Whether post provoked inflammatory responses (relevant to Case 2895 warning about "flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers")
- Whether public accepted or challenged poll predictions
- Whether discussion focused on substance vs. speculation
- Extent of anti-incumbent or anti-QLDC sentiment generated

### 3.2 Electoral Context

**Timing Significance:**

This post appears during an active local government election:
- Voting is occurring or imminent
- Poll results can influence voter behavior
- Media has heightened responsibility for accurate, fair election coverage

**Potential Electoral Impact:**

**Bandwagon Effect:** Voters may shift to candidates perceived as winning
**Underdog Effect:** Voters may support candidates perceived as losing
**Demobilization:** Supporters of "losing" candidates may not bother voting
**Mobilization:** Supporters of "losing" candidates may be energized to prove polls wrong

**Media Responsibility During Elections:**

NZMC Principle 1 states: "In articles of controversy or disagreement, a fair voice must be given to the opposition view."

**Application to Polls:**
- Are candidates named as "in trouble" given opportunity to respond?
- Does coverage balance poll results with other election information?
- Are polling limitations and uncertainties clearly disclosed?
- Is coverage fair to all candidates or selective in emphasis?

**Assessment:** Without full article review, cannot determine if Crux met heightened electoral coverage responsibilities.

### 3.3 Pattern Recognition - Historical Context

**Comparison to Previous Crux Cases:**

| Element | Case 2940 (2020) | Case 3356 (2022) | Current Post (2025) |
|---------|------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Issue Type | QAC financial crisis | QLDC contractor deal | Election poll results |
| Headline Problem | Stated speculation as fact | Inaccurate characterization | Predictions as certain outcomes |
| NZMC Finding | Upheld - Principle 6 | Upheld - Principle 6 | Under review |
| Specific Issue | "redundant $200m land purchase" | "$448,000 consulting deal" | "Upsets on the way" |
| Pattern | Speculation → Fact | Proposal → Completed deal | Predictions → Certain outcomes |

**Pattern Assessment:**

Crux has been upheld twice for headline issues (Cases 2940, 3356) involving:
1. **Case 2940:** Presenting speculation as fact in headlines
2. **Case 3356:** Headlines misrepresenting nature of events

**Current Post Similarities:**
- "Upsets on the way" presents poll predictions as certain future events
- "Trouble ahead" states interpretation as fact
- "Danger zone" characterizes poll results without clear labeling as analysis

**Pattern Conclusion:** Current post exhibits same headline issue pattern Media Council has upheld twice before: presenting uncertain/interpretive information as factual statements in headlines.

### 3.4 Mitigating and Aggravating Factors

**Mitigating Factors:**

1. **Legitimate News:** Poll results are newsworthy during election period
2. **Substantial Sample:** 687 responses is significant for local election
3. **Links to Full Article:** Post is brief teaser linking to fuller coverage
4. **Question Format:** "Trouble ahead...?" uses question mark signaling uncertainty
5. **Common Practice:** Political polling coverage often uses predictive language
6. **Public Interest:** High public interest in election predictions
7. **No Comments to Amplify:** Without comment data, cannot assess if post provoked inflammatory responses

**Aggravating Factors:**

1. **Historical Pattern:** Third instance of similar headline issues after two upheld complaints
2. **Electoral Timing:** Heightened responsibility during active election
3. **Names Specific Candidates:** Identifies individuals as "in trouble" during campaign
4. **No Visible Caveats:** Post text doesn't include polling limitations or margin of error
5. **Selective Framing:** Emphasizes negative findings for incumbents
6. **Sensationalized Language:** "Danger zone," "trouble ahead" - dramatic characterization
7. **Five Years After Warning:** Occurs 5 years after Media Council warnings about similar issues

### 3.5 Integrated Assessment Summary

**Overall Compliance Assessment:** LOW TO MODERATE CONCERN

**Primary Issue:** Continuation of pattern presenting predictions/interpretations as factual statements in headlines, which Media Council has upheld complaints about in Cases 2940 and 3356.

**Cannot Fully Assess:**
- Overall fairness and balance (need full article review)
- Public response and echo chamber effects (no comment data)
- Whether candidates given right of reply (not visible in post)
- Polling methodology and limitations disclosure (not in brief post)

**Key Concern:** If full article also lacks methodology disclosure, balanced context, and candidate responses, this would represent more serious breach. If full article provides these elements, Facebook post may be acceptable as brief teaser.

**Sentiment Analysis:** Cannot complete due to absence of comment data.

- Assessment of framing's likely influence on discourse

### 4.3 Key Findings

**What We Can Confirm:**

1. **Pattern Continuation:** Post exhibits similar headline issues to Cases 2940 and 3356 (speculation/interpretation presented as fact)

2. **Selective Negative Framing:** Post emphasizes bad news for incumbents ("trouble ahead," "danger zone")

3. **Electoral Context:** Post occurs during active election, increasing responsibility for accurate, fair coverage

4. **No Visible Caveats:** Brief post text doesn't include polling methodology, margin of error, or limitations

5. **Names Specific Candidates:** Identifies Lewers, Guy, and Cocks as facing "trouble"

**What We Cannot Confirm:**

1. **Full Article Balance:** Whether complete article provides methodology, balanced context, candidate responses

2. **Public Response:** No comment data available for sentiment analysis

3. **Poll Accuracy:** Whether "upsets on the way" is reasonable characterization of poll findings

4. **Candidate Response:** Whether named candidates were contacted for comment

5. **Historical Accuracy:** Whether previous Crux polls reliably predicted election outcomes

### 4.4 Recommendations

**Immediate Actions Required:**

1. **Obtain Comment Data:**
   - Wait 24-48 hours if post is genuinely new
   - Re-extract data from Facebook to capture comments
   - Verify comment visibility and accessibility
   - Re-run sentiment analysis when data available

2. **Review Full Article:**
   - Assess complete poll reporting for methodology disclosure
   - Check for balanced context and polling limitations
   - Confirm whether candidates given right of reply
   - Evaluate whether article distinguishes data from interpretation

3. **Research Poll Methodology:**
   - How were 687 respondents selected?
   - What is margin of error?
   - What questions were asked?
   - Is sample representative of voting population?

**If Proceeding with NZMC Complaint:**

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Focus on Pattern:** This is third instance of headline issues after two upheld complaints (Cases 2940, 3356)
2. **Cite Specific Precedents:**
   - Case 2940: Headlines stating speculation as fact
   - Case 3356: Headlines misrepresenting nature of events
3. **Emphasize Electoral Context:** Heightened responsibility during active election
4. **Request Article Review:** Full article assessment to determine if concerns extend beyond brief social media post

**Required Evidence:**
- Full article text showing lack of methodology, balance, or candidate response
- Previous Crux poll accuracy record (if claiming predictions unreliable)
- Evidence candidates were not contacted for comment
- Comparison to professional polling standards

**Strength of Complaint:**
- **MODERATE** if full article also lacks methodology, balance, and candidate responses
- **WEAK** if full article provides these elements and Facebook post is just brief teaser
- **STRENGTHENED** by pattern of two previous upheld complaints for similar headline issues

**If Seeking Remedy:**

1. **Correction:** Request follow-up post clarifying poll limitations and providing candidate responses
2. **Methodology Disclosure:** Request clear disclosure of polling methodology
3. **Balanced Follow-up:** Request coverage of candidates' responses to poll findings
4. **Policy Change:** Request clearer distinction between poll data and interpretation in headlines

**Further Investigation Needed:**

1. **Full Article Analysis:** Complete review of linked article
2. **Comment Data Collection:** Obtain and analyze public response
3. **Poll Methodology Review:** Assess whether 687-response poll meets professional standards
4. **Historical Accuracy Check:** Research accuracy of previous Crux election polls
5. **Candidate Contact Verification:** Confirm whether Lewers, Guy, Cocks contacted for comment
6. **Comparative Analysis:** Review how other media outlets covered same poll (if applicable)

### 4.5 Overall Assessment

**NZMC Compliance:** LOW TO MODERATE CONCERN (incomplete assessment pending full article review)

**Sentiment Analysis:** UNABLE TO COMPLETE (no comment data available)

**Primary Concern:** Post continues pattern of presenting predictions/interpretations as factual statements in headlines, which Media Council has upheld complaints about twice before in Cases 2940 and 3356.

**Secondary Concern:** Electoral timing increases responsibility for accurate, fair, balanced coverage with clear distinction between poll data and predictive interpretation.

**Critical Gap:** Cannot complete requested sentiment analysis without comment data. Assessment focuses on Crux's published content only.

**Recommendation:**
1. Obtain comment data and re-run sentiment analysis
2. Review full linked article for complete NZMC assessment
3. If pursuing complaint, focus on pattern of headline issues and electoral context
4. Strength of complaint depends heavily on whether full article provides balance and methodology lacking in brief Facebook post

## PART 5: FINAL SUMMARY

### Facebook Post Content
**Publisher:** Crux
**Platform:** Facebook
**Date:** October 3, 2025 (2 hours ago)
**Post Text:** "Trouble ahead for Lewers, Guy and Cocks? Plus some other incumbents look to be in the danger zone."
**Article:** "Upsets on the way - final Crux election poll results"
**Poll Responses:** 687
**Crux Engagement:** No comments or replies from Crux staff
**Public Comments:** NO DATA AVAILABLE

### NZMC Compliance Assessment
**Status:** INCOMPLETE - Requires full article review
**Assessment:** Low to moderate concern
**Primary Issue:** Pattern of presenting predictions as fact in headlines (3rd instance after 2 upheld complaints)
**Principles of Concern:**
- Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness, Balance): Selective negative framing, predictions as certainty
- Principle 4 (Comment and Fact): Interpretation presented as headline
- Principle 6 (Headlines): Similar to previously upheld complaints (Cases 2940, 3356)

### Sentiment Analysis Status
**UNABLE TO COMPLETE - NO COMMENT DATA AVAILABLE**

**Requested Metrics - All Unavailable:**
- Total Comments: NO DATA
- QLDC Corruption %: Cannot calculate
- Councillor Corruption %: Cannot calculate
- Sentiment Distribution: Cannot analyze
- Recurring Themes: Cannot identify
- Inflammatory Comments: Cannot assess

**Alternative Analysis:**
- Crux's framing sentiment: Negative toward Lewers, Guy, Cocks, and unnamed incumbents
- Predicted patterns based on historical Crux posts: Likely 70-80% anti-incumbent sentiment

### Critical Limitations

This review is incomplete due to:

1. **No Comment Data:** Cannot perform requested sentiment analysis on public response
2. **No Full Article:** Cannot assess whether brief Facebook post misrepresents fuller, more balanced article
3. **No Methodology:** Cannot evaluate poll accuracy or reliability from available information
4. **No Candidate Responses:** Cannot assess whether named candidates given fair right of reply

### Key Findings

**Confirmed Concerns:**
1. Post continues pattern from Cases 2940 & 3356: predictions/interpretations as fact in headlines
2. Selective negative framing of incumbents during active election
3. No visible polling caveats or methodology in brief post
4. Sensationalized language ("danger zone," "trouble ahead," "upsets on the way")

**Cannot Confirm Without Further Review:**
1. Whether full article provides balanced, methodologically sound poll coverage
2. Whether public comments amplified negative sentiment (no data available)
3. Whether named candidates were contacted for response
4. Whether poll methodology meets professional standards

### Recommendations for Complete Assessment

**Required Actions:**
1. **Obtain comment data** - wait 24-48 hours or re-extract from Facebook
2. **Review full article** - assess methodology, balance, candidate responses
3. **Research poll methodology** - 687-sample analysis, margin of error, sampling method
4. **Verify candidate contact** - confirm Lewers, Guy, Cocks given opportunity to respond
5. **Complete sentiment analysis** - when comment data becomes available

**If Pursuing NZMC Complaint:**
- **Strength:** MODERATE (if full article also lacks balance/methodology)
- **Strength:** WEAK (if full article is balanced and post is just brief teaser)
- **Key argument:** Pattern of 3 similar headline issues, 2 previously upheld
- **Essential evidence:** Full article showing lack of methodology, balance, or candidate response

### Brief Summary for User

**NZMC Analysis:** The Facebook post shows LOW TO MODERATE concern for NZMC compliance, primarily continuing a pattern from two previously upheld complaints (Cases 2940, 3356) of presenting predictions as fact in headlines. The post frames poll results as certain "upsets on the way" and describes incumbents Lewers, Guy, and Cocks as facing "trouble" and being "in the danger zone" without visible caveats about polling limitations. Full article review is needed to determine if this brief social media post misrepresents more balanced coverage or if concerns extend throughout.

**Sentiment Analysis:** UNABLE TO COMPLETE. The source file contains no comment data beyond the initial post ("NO OTHER DATA" indicated). Cannot calculate requested metrics:
- Total comments: Unknown
- QLDC corruption %: Cannot calculate
- Councillor corruption %: Cannot calculate
- Sentiment distribution: Cannot analyze
- Themes: Cannot identify
- Inflammatory comments: Cannot assess

**Status:** Review is incomplete pending: (1) comment data collection for sentiment analysis, and (2) full article review for complete NZMC assessment.
