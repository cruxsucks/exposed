# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Lisa Guy's undeclared conflict could derail QLDC $1 billion water CCO
**Publication:** Crux
**Date:** September 27, 2025
**Author:** Peter Newport
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This article reports on a potential conflict of interest involving Councillor Lisa Guy and a vote on transferring $1 billion of QLDC water services to an external Council Controlled Organisation (CCO). The article alleges that Councillor Guy failed to declare a conflict of interest arising from her family business Rationale's consultancy work with QLDC on three waters matters, and that she voted on the CCO decision despite this potential conflict. While the article raises serious questions of public interest regarding conflicts of interest in local government, it breaches NZMC principles by failing to provide balance through right of reply to Councillor Guy and other criticized parties, presenting some opinions as facts, and including potentially defamatory characterizations without substantiation.

---

## Article Summary
The article reports on concerns that a July 31, 2025 vote to transfer QLDC water services to an external CCO may be invalid due to Councillor Lisa Guy's undeclared conflict of interest. Key claims include:
- Councillor Guy's family business Rationale received payment from QLDC for advisory work on "possible responses and opportunities created by the new government's three waters review"
- The Office of the Auditor-General gave approval for this contract but specifically stated the approval "does not suspend the normal prohibition on Councillor Guy discussing or voting on matters in which she has a financial interest"
- Councillor Guy voted in favor of the external CCO on July 31, 2025, providing the crucial vote (with Mayor's casting vote) to approve the measure
- The article suggests this vote may need to be overturned due to the undeclared conflict
- The article also reports on connections between Councillor Guy and election candidate Stephen Brent through a trustee company structure
- Councillor Guy has threatened a Media Council complaint against Crux over reporting about Rationale
- The article references changes to QLDC's Register of Interests regarding Councillor Guy

---

## Context Considerations
ReviewContext.MD indicates that Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections are underway, Crux is a local news site reporting on QLDC matters, and Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council.

The electoral context is significant: this article is published during the 2025 local body elections when Stephen Brent is standing as a candidate for councillor in the Queenstown-Wakatipu ward. The article's reporting on the Brent-Guy connection through EGLG Trustees Ltd may affect voter perceptions of Brent's candidacy.

Additionally, the article reports that Councillor Guy has threatened Crux with a Media Council complaint, creating a potential adversarial relationship between the publication and a subject of its reporting. This context should heighten the importance of scrupulous fairness and accuracy.

The substantive issue - whether a $1 billion public asset transfer vote is valid - is clearly a matter of significant public interest.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**
The article presents several claims that require verification or clearer attribution:

- The central claim that Councillor Guy's Rationale work is "unavoidably connected to the vote in July this year" (line 37) is presented as fact but is actually the author's or Crux's interpretation. Whether the advisory work on "possible responses and opportunities created by the new government's three waters review" creates a direct conflict with the CCO vote is a matter requiring legal analysis or expert opinion.

- The article states "If Councillor Guy was not entitled to vote due to her Rationale advisory work with QLDC on the same subject, then it seems the vote would have to be against the external CCO" (lines 17-18). The word "seems" acknowledges uncertainty, but the article does not provide any legal or procedural authority for whether and how such a vote could be overturned.

- The contract cost discrepancy is reported as fact without clear resolution: "the Queenstown Lakes District Council had entered into new $30,000 Rationale contract" versus "Councillor Guy says the work only cost QLDC $8,000" (lines 23-24). The article does not clarify which figure is correct or how the discrepancy arose.

However, the article does accurately quote the Office of the Auditor-General statement (lines 31-33) and provides verifiable facts about the Companies Register showing EGLG Trustees Ltd (lines 47-50).

**Fairness Issues:**
The article is fundamentally unfair to Councillor Lisa Guy:

- The entire article is built around allegations of potential wrongdoing, yet Guy is not given a fair opportunity to respond. The article states "Councillor Guy did not respond to Crux questions sent to her earlier today" (line 81) - but questions sent "earlier today" do not constitute reasonable time for response to serious allegations.

- The article reports that Guy has made "a number of unsupported claims against Crux" (line 43) and threatened a Media Council complaint (lines 43-44), characterizing her concerns as "unsupported claims" without presenting or analyzing what those claims are. This creates an impression of bad faith or frivolous complaints.

- The article implies deception through the statement "Crux has also discovered multiple changes to the QLDC's Register of Interests regarding Councillor Guy since her election as councillor three years ago. The Stephen Brent run EGLG Trustees Ltd reference disappears after 2023 even though the Companies Register still shows it being active and holding joint majority shares" (lines 55-58). The word "disappears" suggests deliberate concealment, when there may be legitimate explanations for how information is presented in the Register across different years.

The article is also unfair to Stephen Brent:
- Brent is characterized as having an "apparently close relationship to outgoing CEO Mike Theelen" (line 65) without any evidence provided for this claim or explanation of its relevance.
- While Brent's statement is included (line 66), the article was sent to him "today" and states he "did not respond to a number of detailed questions" (line 64). Same-day requests do not provide reasonable response time.

**Balance Issues:**
The article lacks balance in several respects:

- No right of reply from Councillor Guy beyond the statement that she "did not respond" to same-day questions
- No independent legal or procedural analysis of whether the vote could actually be overturned
- No QLDC official comment on the validity of the vote or the conflict of interest allegations
- No explanation from QLDC of why the Register of Interests changed across years
- No context about standard practices for conflict of interest declarations in similar situations
- The article includes an allegation about Mayor Lewers potentially seeking a directorship of the water CCO (lines 70-76), which he denied. While his denial is reported, this side issue seems included to cast further doubt on the process without clear relevance to Guy's conflict.

The article does make efforts at balance by:
- Including Stephen Brent's statement explaining his role (line 66)
- Including Mayor Lewers' denial of seeking CCO directorship (lines 73-75)
- Noting that Crux "will seek a response from QLDC next week" (line 79)

However, these efforts do not provide adequate balance for the serious allegations against Guy.

**Evidence:**

"Whatever the cost of the Rationale consultancy work, it appears to be unavoidably connected to the vote in July this year to take QLDC water services to an external CCO." (line 37) - This is presented as fact but is an interpretation that requires substantiation.

"There is no indication that Councillor Guy declared this conflict and she certainly voted on July 31 in favour of the external CCO." (lines 37-38) - "No indication" is negative inference without positive evidence; the article should clarify whether it examined council records, asked QLDC, or has other basis for this claim.

"In recent days Councillor Guy has made a number of unsupported claims against Crux and our reporting of her connection to Rationale." (line 43) - Characterizing Guy's concerns as "unsupported claims" without presenting them is unfair and potentially misleading.

"Councillor Guy did not respond to Crux questions sent to her earlier today." (line 81) - Same-day questions do not provide reasonable response time for serious allegations.

**Findings:**
The article breaches Principle 1 through lack of fairness and balance. While the underlying story is clearly of public interest, the article makes serious allegations of potential wrongdoing without providing adequate opportunity for response. Sending questions "earlier today" and then publishing the same day does not meet standards of fairness. The article also presents some interpretations as facts and includes unfair characterizations. The exceptions for "long-running issues" do not apply here - this is a discrete article about specific alleged conduct that requires right of reply.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The article systematically fails to distinguish between factual information and interpretative conclusions in several key areas:

**Fact vs. Interpretation Confusion:**

- "Whatever the cost of the Rationale consultancy work, it appears to be unavoidably connected to the vote in July this year to take QLDC water services to an external CCO." (line 37) - This is an interpretative conclusion presented as if it were factual. Whether the advisory work on general "three waters review responses and opportunities" creates a specific conflict with the CCO vote decision is a legal and factual question requiring expert analysis.

- "A crucial vote on moving one billion dollars of QLDC water services to an external Council Controlled Organisation (CCO) could be overturned due to an undeclared piece of advisory work" (lines 11-12) - The word "could" acknowledges uncertainty, but the article does not provide any authoritative source confirming that votes can be overturned in this manner or under what procedures.

- "If Councillor Guy was not entitled to vote due to her Rationale advisory work with QLDC on the same subject, then it seems the vote would have to be against the external CCO." (lines 17-18) - The phrase "it seems" indicates this is interpretation/opinion, not established fact, yet it's presented in news voice as logical conclusion.

**Factual Foundation Issues:**

Some claims lack adequate factual foundation:
- "the Queenstown Lakes District Council had entered into new $30,000 Rationale contract" versus "Councillor Guy says the work only cost QLDC $8,000" (lines 23-24) - The article does not reconcile this significant discrepancy or explain which figure is accurate.

- The article reports the Register of Interests shows "different information" across years (lines 58-61) but doesn't provide specific details of what changed or why.

- The claim about Stephen Brent's "apparently close relationship to outgoing CEO Mike Theelen" (line 65) is stated without any factual basis or evidence.

**Clear Factual Reporting:**

The article does provide clear factual reporting in places:
- Direct quotation from the Office of the Auditor-General (lines 31-33)
- Verifiable information from the Companies Register about EGLG Trustees Ltd (lines 47-50)
- Direct quotes from Stephen Brent (line 66) and Mayor Lewers (lines 73-75)
- Specific dates and vote information (line 15-17)

**Evidence:**

"Whatever the cost of the Rationale consultancy work, it appears to be unavoidably connected to the vote in July this year" (line 37) - Legal/interpretive conclusion presented as factual finding.

"There is no indication that Councillor Guy declared this conflict" (line 37) - Negative inference presented as fact without stating the basis for this claim.

"A crucial vote... could be overturned" (line 11) - Speculation about procedural outcomes presented in declarative headline and opening.

"The Stephen Brent run EGLG Trustees Ltd reference disappears after 2023" (line 56) - The verb "disappears" implies deliberate concealment rather than neutral description of changed register entries.

**Findings:**
The article breaches Principle 4 by failing to maintain clear distinction between established facts and interpretive conclusions. Key claims about whether a conflict exists, whether it should have been declared, and whether the vote could be overturned are presented as factual conclusions when they are actually interpretations requiring expert analysis. The article should have clearly attributed these as Crux's analysis, sought expert legal opinion, or presented them as questions requiring investigation rather than as established findings.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "Lisa Guy's undeclared conflict could derail QLDC $1 billion water CCO"

**Accuracy Assessment:**

The headline contains both factual and problematic elements:

The phrase "undeclared conflict" presents as established fact what is actually an allegation or interpretation. The article provides evidence that:
1. Rationale did advisory work for QLDC on three waters matters
2. The Auditor-General said Guy couldn't vote on matters in which she has a financial interest
3. Guy voted on the CCO decision

However, whether these facts constitute a conflict requiring declaration for this specific vote is an interpretative conclusion, not established fact. The word "conflict" has specific legal meaning in local government law, and declaring something a "conflict" without qualification suggests this has been authoritatively determined.

A more accurate headline would be:
- "Questions raised over Lisa Guy vote on water CCO due to Rationale work"
- "Lisa Guy's Rationale contract may affect water CCO vote validity"
- "Potential conflict of interest raised over Lisa Guy's CCO vote"

**Misleading Elements:**

The headline's use of "undeclared conflict" as definitive fact rather than allegation could mislead readers by:
1. Suggesting a conflict has been authoritatively determined to exist
2. Suggesting Guy deliberately failed to declare something she was obligated to declare
3. Presenting as established fact what the article itself treats more cautiously with phrases like "appears to be" and "could be overturned"

**Substance Reflection:**

The headline does accurately reflect key elements of the article:
- The subject is Lisa Guy and a potential conflict of interest
- The matter concerns the $1 billion water CCO
- The vote could potentially be challenged ("could derail")

The use of "could derail" appropriately signals uncertainty about outcomes.

**Evidence:**

Headline: "Lisa Guy's undeclared conflict could derail QLDC $1 billion water CCO" (line 1)

Compare to article text: "Whatever the cost of the Rationale consultancy work, it appears to be unavoidably connected to the vote" (line 37) - The article uses "appears to be," while the headline states as fact "undeclared conflict."

The article asks: "There is no indication that Councillor Guy declared this conflict" (line 37) - This is softer than the headline's definitive "undeclared conflict."

**Findings:**
The headline breaches Principle 6 by presenting as definitive fact ("undeclared conflict") what the article itself treats as interpretation and allegation. While the headline reflects key elements of the story, it overstates the certainty of the claims. The phrase "undeclared conflict" should have been attributed or softened to "potential conflict" or "alleged conflict" to accurately reflect that this is a matter of interpretation and investigation, not established fact.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Pre-existing Relationship:**

The article reports that Councillor Guy has threatened Crux with a Media Council complaint: "On Friday September 26 (yesterday) she emailed Crux threatening a complaint to the NZ Media Council if we did not remove our references to her family business, Rationale." (lines 43-44)

This creates a potential adversarial relationship between Crux and Councillor Guy that may affect the objectivity and fairness of reporting. The article is published the day after Guy's threat, suggesting it may be a response to that threat.

**Disclosure:**

The article does disclose that Guy has threatened a complaint and that Mayor Lewers "has given his support to Lisa Guy's online complaints about Crux reporting" (line 83). This provides some context for readers to understand the relationship between Crux and its subjects.

However, the article does not disclose:
- That this story may be motivated in part by the threat of a Media Council complaint
- That Crux has an interest in defending its previous reporting about Guy and Rationale
- The nature of Guy's concerns about Crux's reporting

**Defensive Reporting:**

The article has elements of defensive journalism - reporting that serves to justify or defend the publication's previous coverage. The article states: "In recent days Councillor Guy has made a number of unsupported claims against Crux and our reporting of her connection to Rationale" (line 43). Characterizing Guy's concerns as "unsupported claims" without presenting those claims appears defensive.

The timing - publishing the day after Guy's threat - and the framing of her concerns as "unsupported claims" raise questions about whether this article is driven by news value or by defending Crux's position in an anticipated Media Council complaint.

**Public Interest vs. Self-Interest:**

Despite these concerns, the article does address matters of clear public interest:
- Whether a $1 billion public asset transfer vote is valid
- Whether conflicts of interest were properly declared
- Transparency in local government decision-making
- Electoral candidate connections to current controversies

The public interest in these matters is substantial and legitimate, even if Crux also has self-interest in defending its reporting.

**Evidence:**

"On Friday September 26 (yesterday) she emailed Crux threatening a complaint to the NZ Media Council if we did not remove our references to her family business, Rationale." (lines 43-44) - Establishes adversarial relationship.

"In recent days Councillor Guy has made a number of unsupported claims against Crux and our reporting of her connection to Rationale." (line 43) - Defensive characterization of Guy's concerns.

"Mayor Lewers has given his support to Lisa Guy's online complaints about Crux reporting." (line 83) - Further evidence of adversarial relationship.

Article published September 27, one day after Guy's threat on September 26.

**Findings:**
The article constitutes a potential breach of Principle 10 through inadequate disclosure of the adversarial relationship between Crux and Councillor Guy. While the article does mention Guy's threat, it does not adequately disclose how this relationship may affect the reporting or acknowledge Crux's interest in defending its previous coverage. The characterization of Guy's concerns as "unsupported claims" without presenting them suggests defensive journalism. However, the underlying story is clearly of public interest, which complicates the assessment. More explicit disclosure of the context and conflict would have strengthened the article's credibility.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise privacy concerns. All individuals named (Councillor Guy, Mayor Lewers, Stephen Brent, CEO Mike Theelen) are public officials engaged in public roles or election candidates. The matters discussed relate to public council business, financial interests in public contracts, and electoral candidacies, which are clearly matters of public interest and public record.

The information about family business arrangements (EGLG Trustees Ltd) is drawn from public Companies Register information and relates to public contracts and conflict of interest questions.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical or mental disability. While it features reporting on public officials who may have various demographic characteristics, these characteristics are not gratuitously emphasized or made relevant to the coverage.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article is presented as news reporting by Peter Newport and is not labeled as opinion or column content. It does not appear to require assessment under Principle 5, as it is clearly presented as news rather than opinion.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article does not appear to rely on confidential sources. Information is attributed to public records (Companies Register, Office of the Auditor-General statements, QLDC Register of Interests) and on-the-record statements from Stephen Brent and Mayor Lewers. No confidentiality issues arise.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. The information appears to be drawn from public records and direct inquiries.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text provided does not include photographs or graphics details. Cannot assess from available information.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The article fails to provide fair opportunity for right of reply to Councillor Lisa Guy on serious allegations of potential wrongdoing. Questions were sent "earlier today" and the article published the same day, not providing reasonable response time. The article also includes unfair characterizations (Guy's "unsupported claims," Brent's "apparently close relationship") and lacks balance through independent analysis of the legal and procedural questions raised.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The article fails to maintain clear distinction between established facts and interpretive conclusions. Key claims about whether a conflict exists requiring declaration and whether the vote could be overturned are presented as factual findings when they are actually interpretations requiring legal analysis.

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - BREACH**: The headline presents as definitive fact ("undeclared conflict") what the article itself treats as interpretation and allegation. The headline overstates the certainty of the claims.

4. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article inadequately discloses the adversarial relationship between Crux and Councillor Guy arising from her threat of a Media Council complaint. The characterization of Guy's concerns as "unsupported claims" without presenting them suggests defensive journalism.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This article shows several concerning patterns:

1. **Insufficient Response Time**: Publishing serious allegations the same day questions are sent does not provide fair opportunity for response, particularly when the subject is a sitting councillor who may need to consult records or legal advice.

2. **Defensive Framing**: The article appears partly motivated by defending Crux's previous reporting against Guy's threatened complaint, creating questions about whether news judgment or self-interest drives the coverage.

3. **Interpretation as Fact**: The article repeatedly presents interpretive conclusions about legal and procedural matters as established facts rather than clearly identifying them as requiring expert analysis.

4. **Negative Inference**: The article relies on negative inference ("no indication that Councillor Guy declared," "did not respond to Crux questions") without adequate disclosure of what efforts were made to obtain positive information.

5. **Electoral Context**: Publishing during an election period when Stephen Brent is a candidate adds another layer of complexity, as the article may affect voter perceptions without providing adequate balance or context.

Given the ReviewContext.MD note that "Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council," these patterns are particularly concerning as they suggest ongoing issues with fairness and accuracy standards.

---

**Public Interest Analysis:**

Despite the breaches identified, the article addresses matters of substantial public interest:

1. **Financial Accountability**: Whether conflicts of interest are properly declared in decisions about $1 billion of public assets is clearly significant to ratepayers and the community.

2. **Governance Transparency**: Questions about the validity of council votes and proper conflict of interest procedures are important for democratic accountability.

3. **Electoral Information**: During an election period, information about candidates' connections to controversial matters (Stephen Brent/EGLG Trustees Ltd) may be relevant to voters.

4. **Public Record**: The Office of the Auditor-General's specific restriction on Guy voting on matters in which she has a financial interest is a matter of public record requiring public scrutiny.

The challenge is that these legitimate public interest matters have been reported in a manner that breaches standards of fairness and accuracy. The story could have been told with the same public interest impact while providing fair opportunity for response and clearly distinguishing facts from interpretations.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC, most likely to be brought by Councillor Lisa Guy, citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The article fails to provide fair opportunity for right of reply. Specific grounds:
   - Questions sent "earlier today" with same-day publication do not provide reasonable response time
   - Serious allegations of potential wrongdoing (undeclared conflict, possible vote invalidation) published without adequate opportunity for response
   - Unfair characterization of Guy's concerns as "unsupported claims" without presenting or analyzing those concerns
   - Lack of independent legal or procedural analysis of central claims

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The article fails to clearly distinguish between factual information and interpretive conclusions. Specific grounds:
   - Whether a conflict exists requiring declaration presented as fact rather than interpretation
   - Whether the vote "could be overturned" presented without authoritative procedural basis
   - "Unavoidably connected" is interpretive conclusion presented as factual finding

3. **Principle 6 - Headlines and Captions**: The headline presents opinion/interpretation as fact. Specific grounds:
   - "Undeclared conflict" stated as definitive fact when article itself uses softer language ("appears to be," "no indication")
   - Headline overstates certainty of allegations

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: The article inadequately discloses adversarial relationship between Crux and Guy arising from threatened Media Council complaint.

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Inadequate Response Time:**
   - "Councillor Guy did not respond to Crux questions sent to her earlier today." (line 81) - Same-day questions and publication
   - "Stephen Brent did not respond to a number of detailed questions from Crux today" (line 64) - Same-day timeframe

2. **Fact vs. Interpretation:**
   - Headline: "Lisa Guy's undeclared conflict could derail QLDC $1 billion water CCO" - "Undeclared conflict" as definitive fact
   - "Whatever the cost of the Rationale consultancy work, it appears to be unavoidably connected to the vote" (line 37) - Interpretation as fact
   - "There is no indication that Councillor Guy declared this conflict" (line 37) - Negative inference without stating basis

3. **Unfair Characterization:**
   - "In recent days Councillor Guy has made a number of unsupported claims against Crux" (line 43) - Characterizes concerns as "unsupported" without presenting them
   - Reference to Stephen Brent's "apparently close relationship to outgoing CEO Mike Theelen" (line 65) - Unsupported claim

4. **Adversarial Context:**
   - "On Friday September 26 (yesterday) she emailed Crux threatening a complaint to the NZ Media Council" (line 43) - Article published day after threat
   - Pattern of defensive framing regarding Guy's concerns about Crux reporting

---

**Required Actions per NZMC Procedure:**

**Step 1 - Complaint to Publisher (Crux):**
- **Timing**: Must be within one calendar month of first publication (September 27, 2025)
- **Deadline**: October 27, 2025
- **Method**: Written complaint clearly marked as complaint to publisher
- **Content**: Should cite specific principle breaches and request:
  - Correction acknowledging inadequate opportunity for response
  - Right of reply for Councillor Guy to respond to allegations
  - Correction to headline to remove "undeclared conflict" as definitive statement
  - Clarification that whether a conflict exists and whether vote could be overturned are matters requiring legal analysis
  - Disclosure of Guy's specific concerns about Crux reporting that were characterized as "unsupported claims"

**Step 2 - Escalation to NZMC (if necessary):**
- **Timing**: If no response within 10 working days, or if response is unsatisfactory
- **Deadline**: Within 20 working days of publisher's response (or non-response)
- **Method**: Online complaint form at NZMC website
- **Requirements**:
  - State principles breached (Principles 1, 4, 6, and potentially 10)
  - Provide article link and copy
  - Include initial complaint to publisher and their response
  - Provide key points in 500 words
  - Provide proper name (will be published unless exceptional circumstances)
  - Sign waiver (no other formal action regarding same article)

**Step 3 - Supporting Documentation to Gather:**
- Copy of article as published (screenshot and text)
- Screenshot of Guy's email to Crux threatening Media Council complaint (if available)
- QLDC records of council votes on July 31, 2025

- Office of the Auditor-General correspondence with QLDC regarding Rationale contract
- Documentation of when questions were sent to Guy and when article was published
- Any previous Crux articles about Guy and Rationale referenced in this article

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of the decision with fair prominence in the section where original article ran

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for Councillor Lisa Guy to respond to allegations, to be given fair prominence similar to original article

4. **Correction/Retraction**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Article failed to provide adequate opportunity for response
   - "Undeclared conflict" is interpretation/allegation, not established fact
   - Whether conflict exists and whether vote could be overturned require legal analysis
   - Guy's concerns about Crux reporting should have been presented rather than characterized as "unsupported claims"

5. **Headline Correction**: Request that headline be modified to remove "undeclared conflict" as definitive statement, replacing with "potential conflict" or "alleged conflict"

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Standing**: Councillor Lisa Guy has clear standing to bring this complaint as the primary subject of the allegations. She may wish to consult with legal counsel about both the Media Council complaint and the substantive conflict of interest allegations.

2. **Timing**: The complaint deadline of October 27, 2025 provides some time, but earlier action may be preferable given the electoral context.

3. **Substantive vs. Process Issues**: Guy should consider whether to focus the complaint purely on media standards breaches (inadequate response time, fact/interpretation confusion, unfair characterization) or also address the substantive allegations. The Media Council addresses ethical journalism, not the truth of underlying claims.

4. **Electoral Impact**: The article's publication during Stephen Brent's candidacy adds complexity. Brent may have separate grounds for complaint regarding the characterization of his "apparently close relationship" with the CEO, though he is less directly affected than Guy.

5. **Crux History**: The ReviewContext.MD indicates Crux "has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council." Previous NZMC rulings against Crux may be relevant to demonstrate pattern of similar breaches.

6. **Public Interest Defense**: Crux will likely argue strong public interest in reporting on conflict of interest issues. The complaint should acknowledge this public interest while arguing that legitimate stories must still meet fairness and accuracy standards.

7. **Defensive Journalism**: The fact that this article was published the day after Guy threatened a Media Council complaint raises questions about motivation. However, this is difficult to prove and may be better left as context rather than primary complaint ground.

**Conclusion:**

This article addresses matters of substantial public interest - potential conflicts of interest in a $1 billion public asset decision - but does so in a manner that breaches NZMC standards for fairness and accuracy. The most serious breach is the failure to provide adequate opportunity for right of reply, with questions sent and article published on the same day. Additionally, the article presents legal and procedural interpretations as established facts without expert analysis or clear attribution.

The article's publication one day after Councillor Guy threatened Crux with a Media Council complaint raises questions about defensive journalism, though the underlying story clearly has independent news value.

A formal complaint by Councillor Guy would be warranted, focusing on the inadequate response time, confusion of fact and interpretation, and misleading headline. Such a complaint would serve the public interest by upholding standards of fair journalism, even as the substantive questions about conflict of interest separately require proper investigation through appropriate governance and legal channels.

The article exemplifies the challenge of investigative journalism on matters of public importance: the story is important and legitimate, but the execution falls short of ethical standards that protect both public interest and individual fairness.
