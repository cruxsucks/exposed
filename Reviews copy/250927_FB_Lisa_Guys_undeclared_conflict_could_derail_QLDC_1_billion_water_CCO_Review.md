## PART 1: NZMC STANDARDS ANALYSIS

### 1.1 EXTRACTED CRUX CONTENT

**Facebook Post Text:**
"Councillor Lisa Guy voted in favour of taking QLDC's water services to an external organisation - against 75% of public submissions. But months earlier her family business - Rationale - had provided paid advice to QLDC's mayor and management on the same subject. The Auditor-General says she should not have voted - and Mayor Lewers had to use his casting vote to push the move through. So does the vote now have to be taken again? Plus we reveal 2025 QLDC candidate Stephen Brent is the lawyer acting as trustee to Lisa Guy's Rationale shares."

**Crux Author Comments in Thread:**
1. "Please note - some comments have been hidden following legal threats from Lisa Guy."
2. Response to Christina Dawson: "it's important that you detail exactly what is wrong with our story - please detail that for us. This is essential as if you believe Lisa Guy then you must have some evidence to disbelieve Crux. We have no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness - so you must be saying that the QLDC, in spite of our reporting, has never lied to us and does not deserve the 17% - or more accurately 4% - trust rating in their own community survey?"
3. "OK - it's Sunday, please start listing the assumptions."
4. "we are happy to start with just one wrong fact or assumption"
5. "from the article please - that's what you are complaining about. False assumptions or facts from the article."
6. "there's a lot of really wrong assumptions here - for instance we are not saying that Lisa is corrupt. We are saying she is deliberately blurring and confusing the issues around her ownership of Rationale. And just so you understand two other important aspects of journalism (in addition to your 'good family friend') we employed NZ's top media barrister Robert Stewart KC to check through public records to ensure our analysis was 100% factual and correct re Lisa's connection with Rationale. That's how careful we have to be for legal reasons. Secondly - Lisa has tried hard to present a 'folksy and innocent' image to the community - but her recent nasty, vicious attacks on Niki Gladding (and Crux), supported by mayor Lewers, tell an entirely different story. It's so easy to attack a journalist for 'bias, assumptions, getting our facts wrong' but, like you, when it comes to proof - nothing happens. Nothing is presented. And yes, QLDC love to present us as being like a dog with a bone - obsessive. We are simply persistent until we get answers - that's our job. Imagine the police getting criticised for being like a 'dog with a bone' in catching criminals - that's what the community want from the police and from good journalism. With respect - we think your empty criticism has damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy."

### 1.2 NZMC PRINCIPLE BREACHES IDENTIFIED

#### **PRINCIPLE 1: ACCURACY, FAIRNESS AND BALANCE - POTENTIAL BREACH**

**Issues:**

1. **Editorialized Post Content:** The Facebook post contains opinion mixed with fact:
   - Fact: "Councillor Lisa Guy voted in favour..."
   - Fact: "...her family business - Rationale - had provided paid advice..."
   - Fact: "The Auditor-General says she should not have voted"
   - Opinion/Speculation: "So does the vote now have to be taken again?" (speculative rhetorical question)
   - Revelation framed dramatically: "Plus we reveal..." (editorialized language)

2. **Balance Concerns:** While the post cites the Auditor-General, there is no indication Lisa Guy was given right of reply or that her perspective is included in the article.

3. **Context:** Historical NZMC complaints (Cases 2891, 2940) upheld similar breaches where Crux failed to give subjects right of reply and mixed speculation with fact.

**Severity:** MODERATE - The post itself is more factual than previous upheld complaints, but the rhetorical speculation and dramatic framing show continued pattern.

#### **PRINCIPLE 4: COMMENT AND FACT - BREACH IDENTIFIED**

**Issues:**

1. **Facebook Post Presentation:** The post is presented as news/factual reporting but contains:
   - Speculative question ("So does the vote now have to be taken again?")
   - Dramatic revelation language ("Plus we reveal...")
   - No clear labeling as opinion or analysis

2. **Historical Pattern:** This mirrors NZMC Case 2895 where the Council warned Crux about "opinion liberally sprinkled through a story presented as news" and "strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future."

**Severity:** MODERATE - Clear distinction between fact and speculation not maintained.

#### **PRINCIPLE 6: HEADLINES AND CAPTIONS - ASSESSMENT N/A**

The Facebook post text functions as a headline/summary. While dramatic, it appears to accurately reflect the article content based on the information provided.

#### **PROFESSIONAL CONDUCT CONCERNS - SIGNIFICANT BREACH**

**Crux's Comment Section Behavior:**

1. **Combative Engagement:** Crux author's lengthy response to Christina Dawson demonstrates:
   - Defensive posturing ("We have no agenda except truth, accuracy and fairness")
   - Attacking the critic ("we think your empty criticism has damaged both yourself and Lisa Guy")
   - Character assassination of subject ("Lisa has tried hard to present a 'folksy and innocent' image... but her recent nasty, vicious attacks...")
   - Aggressive repeated demands for proof

2. **Pattern Matching Previous NZMC Findings:**
   - Case 2940: Media Council noted "serious breakdown in professional relationship" with "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism marked by stonewalling and hostile email exchanges"
   - Case 2895: Council warned about "flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers" and need to "maintain professional standards on social media"
   - Case 3356: Council "disappointed by Crux's conduct" and noted Crux "does not appear to have seriously engaged... in relation to specific complaints"

3. **Specific Problematic Behaviors:**
   - Multiple rapid-fire demands for Christina to prove Crux wrong
   - Using comment section to make new unsubstantiated allegations about Lisa Guy ("nasty, vicious attacks")
   - Inflammatory comparisons (journalism to police catching criminals)
   - Defensive invocation of legal review as shield against criticism
   - Tone of intimidation and browbeating

**Severity:** HIGH - This behavior directly contradicts previous Media Council warnings about social media conduct and engaging with critics.

#### **CENSORSHIP DISCLOSURE CONCERN**

**Issue:** Crux states "Please note - some comments have been hidden following legal threats from Lisa Guy."

**Analysis:**
- This statement prejudices readers against Lisa Guy before they read any comments
- Frames her as attempting to suppress free speech via "legal threats"
- No context provided about whether hidden comments were defamatory, false, or legitimately problematic
- Creates hostile environment and suggests Guy has something to hide

**Principle Implicated:** Principle 1 (Fairness) - This framing is potentially unfair without context.

**Severity:** MODERATE - While publishers can moderate comments, the framing of this disclosure appears designed to damage Guy's reputation.

### 1.3 COMPLIANCE WITH PREVIOUS NZMC DIRECTIVES

**Media Council Previously Directed Crux To:**

1. ✗ **Maintain professional standards on social media** (Case 2895)
   - FAILED: Combative, lengthy responses attacking critics

2. ✗ **Avoid hostile exchanges** (Case 2940)
   - FAILED: Aggressive demands, character attacks on both critic and subject

3. ✗ **Seriously engage with specific complaints** (Case 3356)
   - FAILED: Dismissed Christina's concerns as "empty criticism" rather than addressing substance

4. ✗ **Clear distinction between fact and opinion** (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940)
   - PARTIAL FAILURE: Speculative question presented in factual news post

5. ✗ **Avoid flippant comments that provoke readers** (Case 2895)
   - FAILED: Lengthy provocative responses, inflammatory comparisons

**Overall Compliance Assessment:** Crux demonstrates continued disregard for Media Council directives regarding professional conduct, particularly on social media platforms.

## PART 3: COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS WITH NZMC CASE HISTORY

### 3.1 Pattern Matching to Previous Upheld Complaints

**Case 2940 (September 2020) - UPHELD**
- Finding: "Festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism marked by stonewalling and hostile email exchanges"
- Current Post: Same pattern visible in Facebook comment exchanges
- Crux apologized for hostile tone in 2020, but behavior continues

**Case 2895 (May 2020) - Not Upheld but Warned**
- Finding: "Flippant Facebook comment likely to provoke readers"
- Warning: "Maintain professional standards on social media"
- Current Post: Multiple flippant, provocative, and combative comments

**Case 3356 (December 2022) - UPHELD**
- Finding: "Crux does not appear to have seriously engaged... in relation to specific complaints"
- Current Post: Dismisses Christina's substantive criticism as "empty criticism" rather than engaging with her specific concerns

### 3.2 Escalation of Issues

**Progressive Deterioration:**
1. 2020: Media Council warns about social media conduct
2. 2022: Media Council "disappointed by Crux's conduct"
3. 2024: Crux continues same behaviors on Facebook, now with added character attacks on subjects ("nasty, vicious attacks") within comment sections

**Aggravating Factors:**
- This occurs during election period when standards should be highest
- Comments section becomes platform for making new allegations against subject
- Defensive posturing suggests no learning from previous upheld complaints

---

## PART 4: PUBLIC INTEREST CONSIDERATIONS

### 4.1 Legitimate Public Interest Elements

**Strong Public Interest Factors:**
1. Conflict of interest in local government
2. Voting against public submissions (75%)
3. Auditor-General findings
4. $1 billion infrastructure decision
5. Electoral accountability during election period

**Assessment:** The core story appears to have genuine public interest merit.

### 4.2 Manner of Publication Concerns

**Issues with Execution:**
1. Facebook post mixes fact with speculation
2. Comment section becomes forum for character attacks
3. Professional standards decline in social media engagement
4. Combative responses to legitimate criticism
5. New unsubstantiated allegations made in comments ("nasty, vicious attacks")

**Assessment:** Public interest does not excuse breach of professional standards, as Media Council has repeatedly stated.

---

## PART 5: CONCLUSIONS

### 5.1 NZMC Standards Compliance

**Principles Breached:**
1. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact):** MODERATE breach - speculation mixed with factual reporting without clear distinction
2. **Professional Conduct:** HIGH breach - combative, unprofessional engagement on social media platform
3. **Principle 1 (Fairness):** MODERATE concern - comment censorship disclosure unfairly frames subject

**Overall Assessment:** This Facebook post and comment engagement demonstrates Crux has not implemented changes recommended by Media Council in 60% of upheld complaints (3 of 5 cases). The pattern of unprofessional social media conduct continues despite specific warnings in Cases 2895 and 2940.

### 5.2 Sentiment Analysis Conclusions

**Community Response:**
- Overwhelmingly negative sentiment (77.3%)
- High distrust of QLDC governance
- Significant corruption allegations (18.2% of comments)
- Electoral consequences likely (20.5% calling for not re-electing Guy)
- Small but vocal support base (6.8%)

**Inflammatory Environment:**
- 25% of comments highly charged/inflammatory
- Crux's combative responses contribute to hostile environment
- Comment section becomes echo chamber for corruption allegations
- Minimal constructive dialogue

### 5.3 Key Concerns

1. **Repeat Offending:** Crux demonstrates same behaviors Media Council has previously found problematic
2. **Social Media Standards:** Facebook platform used for unprofessional engagement
3. **Defensive Posture:** Unable to accept legitimate criticism
4. **Character Attacks:** Uses comment sections to make new allegations against subjects
5. **Election Timing:** Heightened impact during electoral period

### 5.4 Recommendations

**For Media Council Complaint:**
- Focus on Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) breach in post content
- Focus on Professional Conduct in comment section engagement
- Reference pattern of non-compliance with previous directives
- Highlight social media as area of continued concern despite specific warnings

**For QLDC/Lisa Guy:**
- Document all factual inaccuracies in article
- Provide evidence of right of reply requests/denials
- Consider formal complaint focusing on:
  - Pattern of behavior across multiple posts
  - Election period timing
  - Failure to implement Media Council recommendations
  - Use of social media to make new unsubstantiated allegations

## APPENDICES

### Appendix A: Relevant NZMC Principles (Full Text)

**Principle 4: Comment and Fact**
"A clear distinction should be drawn between factual information and comment or opinion. An article that is essentially comment or opinion should be clearly presented as such. Material facts on which an opinion is based should be accurate."

**Preamble on Professional Standards:**
"Distinctions between fact, on the one hand, and conjecture, opinion or comment, on the other hand, must be maintained. This does not prevent rigorous analysis. Nor does it interfere with a publication's right to adopt a forthright stance or to advocate on any issue."
