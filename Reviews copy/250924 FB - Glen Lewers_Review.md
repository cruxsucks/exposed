# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Glyn Lewers QLDC Mayor's Post (Facebook) and Crux Response
**Publication:** Facebook (Glyn Lewers) / Crux
**Date:** September 24, 2025
**Author:** Glyn Lewers (Mayor) / Crux
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This review examines a Facebook post by QLDC Mayor Glyn Lewers during the election period, responding to an earlier opinion piece by Niki Gladding about the CEO recruitment process. The post is followed by a comment from Crux requesting documentary proof of the Mayor's claims. The Mayor's post presents his rebuttal to Gladding's allegations, addressing four specific areas: CEO recruitment, political donations, Lakeview, removal from committees, and Regional Deals. While the Mayor's post itself is political speech during an election and not subject to NZMC standards, Crux's response raises questions about their role as a publication and their earlier coverage that prompted this response. This review focuses on the broader context of balance and fairness in electoral coverage.

## Article Summary
The content consists of two parts:

**Part 1: Mayor Glyn Lewers' Facebook Post (lines 1-46)**
The Mayor's detailed response to Niki Gladding's earlier opinion piece, structured as follows:
- Introduction noting the prevalence of "assertions and shared opinion" during the campaign
- Concern about Gladding's opinion piece and support from other mayoral candidates
- Point-by-point rebuttal of allegations made in Gladding's piece:
  1. CEO recruitment process - defends the process as following proper procedure
  2. Political donations - addresses concerns about Rod Drury donation
  3. Lakeview - defends rejection of Gladding's motion
  4. Committee removal - provides context for Gladding's removal from committees
  5. Regional Deals - rebuts claims about blocking access to information
- Conclusion emphasizing the importance of experience in local government

**Part 2: Crux Comment (lines 49-50)**
Crux challenges the Mayor's claims, requesting:
- Detailed information about CEO recruitment process
- Documentary proof rather than verbal assurances
- Confirmation whether the process can be unwound
- Justification based on QLDC's past failures to "tell the truth"

---

## Context Considerations
The ReviewContext.MD identifies this is during the Queenstown Lakes District Council local government elections. Crux is a local news site covering QLDC matters with a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council.

This Facebook post is the Mayor's response to an earlier Crux publication - the Niki Gladding opinion piece dated September 3, 2025 (reviewed separately). The Mayor's post reveals he felt compelled to respond publicly to what he characterizes as "inaccurate and misleading information."

Key electoral context:
- Multiple mayoral candidates are competing, including Gladding and the unnamed candidate referenced in lines 24-25
- The CEO recruitment process is a contentious campaign issue
- The Mayor is seeking a second term
- Gladding is seeking a third term but for a different ward
- The election period heightens the importance of balanced coverage

The fact that the Mayor felt compelled to use Facebook to respond suggests he may not have received opportunity for right of reply in the original Crux article or subsequent coverage.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Not Directly Applicable to Mayor's Post / Concerns About Overall Coverage Pattern

**Analysis:**

**Mayor's Facebook Post:**
The Mayor's Facebook post itself is not subject to NZMC standards as it is political speech by an elected official on his personal/campaign social media. However, it provides important context about the original Crux article and raises questions about whether the Mayor was given fair opportunity for right of reply.

**Crux's Role and Coverage Pattern:**
The existence of this Facebook post and Crux's response comment reveal several concerns about balance and fairness in Crux's overall election coverage:

1. **Lack of Right of Reply in Original Coverage:**
The Mayor's Facebook post appears to be his first substantial opportunity to respond to Gladding's allegations published by Crux on September 3, 2025. If the Mayor was not contacted for comment or offered right of reply before Crux published Gladding's opinion piece, this would constitute a breach of Principle 1.

2. **Crux's Response to the Mayor's Rebuttal:**
Crux's comment (lines 49-50) is revealing in several ways:
- Dismissive tone: "a lot of your comments are subjective and not easily fact checked"
- Demands documentary proof while having published Gladding's claims without such proof
- States "QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past. And that's a fact" - making broad accusations without evidence
- No acknowledgment that they should have sought this information before publishing Gladding's allegations
- No indication they will provide the Mayor equal platform to respond

3. **Double Standard:**
Crux appears to apply different standards to different parties:
- Published Gladding's opinion piece without demanding documentary proof of her allegations
- Published claims about the Mayor without seeking his response
- When the Mayor responds via Facebook, Crux demands documentary proof and questions credibility
- This suggests selective skepticism favoring one political perspective

**Evidence:**

Mayor's statement revealing lack of prior balance:
"When inaccurate and misleading information is shared, it is only appropriate for the public - including other mayoral candidates - to be aware of the correct information." (lines 9-10) - Suggests the Mayor is using Facebook because correct information was not included in original coverage.

"Niki knows this, yet chooses to ignore the facts." (line 10) - Implies the original article published claims despite contrary facts being available.

"For those who have not read it - the opinion piece incorrectly suggests..." (line 10) - The Mayor is responding to published content, suggesting he was not given opportunity to correct these claims before publication.

Crux's response: "It's not enough for you and other councillors to 'tell' the community things - we need documentary proof, because QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past. And that's a fact." (lines 49-50)
- This reveals an adversarial stance toward council/mayor
- Makes broad accusations ("failed to tell the truth") without specifics
- Demands documentation from the Mayor while having published Gladding's claims without such verification
- No acknowledgment they should have sought this information before publishing allegations

**Findings:**
While the Mayor's Facebook post itself is not subject to NZMC review, it evidences a broader pattern of imbalanced coverage. If Crux published Gladding's allegations without:
1. Seeking the Mayor's response before publication
2. Verifying claims with documentary evidence
3. Providing the Mayor equal opportunity to present his perspective

Then the original article (and potentially the coverage pattern) would breach Principle 1's requirement for fairness and balance.

Crux's comment response compounds this concern by demanding standards from the Mayor (documentary proof) that they did not apply to Gladding's original allegations.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Concerns About Crux's Handling of Fact vs. Opinion

**Analysis:**

**Mayor's Post:**
The Mayor's post clearly distinguishes between fact and opinion:
- "I am not here to comment on Niki's views, but I am here to inform people of the facts." (line 8)
- Provides specific procedural details (procurement process, committee composition)
- References verifiable documents (Environment Court Decision No. [2025] NZEnvC 97)
- Distinguishes between process facts and his opinions about them

**Crux's Original Coverage (as evidenced by this exchange):**
The Mayor's rebuttal reveals that Crux's original coverage may have failed to distinguish fact from opinion:

Lines 17-23 show the Mayor correcting what he identifies as factual errors in Gladding's opinion piece:
- Opinion piece alleged committee "selected the recruitment consultancy 'without delegation, mandate or notice to councillors'" - Mayor states "This is untrue."
- Claims about the recruitment process - Mayor provides contradictory procedural facts
- Allegations about blocking councillor access - Mayor states these are "misleading and false"

**Crux's Response:**
Crux's comment blurs fact and opinion:
- "QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past. And that's a fact." (line 50) - Presents opinion as fact
- Makes serious allegation about dishonesty without specific evidence or examples
- No distinction between which claims are opinion and which are alleged facts

**Evidence:**

Mayor correcting factual errors in published opinion:
"The opinion piece alleged that the CE Performance Review Committee (comprising myself, Cllrs Lisa Guy and Lyal Cocks) selected the recruitment consultancy 'without delegation, mandate or notice to councillors'. This is untrue." (lines 20-21)

"A full and documented procurement process was led by Council's Procurement Manager and followed normal council procedures." (lines 21-22)

"Over the weekend, A Mayoral candidate has received advice from four sitting councillors that the allegations made are false - that they are comfortable with the process so far, and it follows the same process used over the past 10 years." (lines 24-25) - Indicates verifiable facts contradicting published claims.

Crux presenting opinion as fact:
"QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past. And that's a fact." (line 50) - No evidence provided for this serious allegation, yet presented as established fact.

**Findings:**
The exchange reveals concerns about whether Crux's original coverage maintained clear distinction between Gladding's opinions and factual claims. The Mayor's detailed rebuttal with specific procedural facts suggests the original article may have presented opinion as fact without verification.

Crux's response comment itself breaches Principle 4 by presenting a serious allegation about dishonesty as "fact" without evidence or specifics.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Issues with Original Article Labeling

**Analysis:**

The Mayor's post references "the opinion piece" (line 10) published by Crux. This raises questions about how the original article was labeled and whether it met Principle 5 requirements.

**Foundation of Fact:**
The Mayor's rebuttal reveals that many claims in the "opinion piece" lacked factual foundation:

1. CEO Recruitment: Mayor states procurement followed "normal council procedures" with "full and documented procurement process" - contradicting opinion piece claims
2. Four sitting councillors confirmed the process "follows the same process used over the past 10 years" - factual verification available but apparently not sought
3. Lakeview: Mayor provides specific procedural reasoning (standing orders, legal risk)
4. Committee removal: Mayor cites specific democratic process (8 of 10 members voted) and court decision (Environment Court Decision No. [2025] NZEnvC 97)
5. Regional Deals: Mayor clarifies he "is not the chair" and doesn't control access to papers

**Evidence:**

Foundation of fact issues revealed by rebuttal:
"A Mayoral candidate has received advice from four sitting councillors that the allegations made are false - that they are comfortable with the process so far" (lines 24-25) - Suggests factual verification was available but not sought before publishing allegations.

"The judgment of the Environment Court confirmed the information was indeed confidential. (Refer Decision No. [2025] NZEnvC 97)" (line 37) - Citable court decision supports Mayor's position, apparently not referenced in original opinion piece.

"The Regional Deals joint committee is a group of two elected members across three councils (ORC, QLDC and CODC)." (line 40) - Basic factual structure apparently misrepresented in opinion piece.

**Findings:**
Even if the original article was labeled as "opinion," Principle 5 requires "foundation of fact." The Mayor's detailed rebuttal with specific facts, procedures, and verifiable sources suggests the original opinion piece may have lacked adequate factual foundation, particularly given that contradictory facts were apparently readily available from sitting councillors and public records.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Not Applicable to Current Material

**Analysis:**
The Facebook post and Crux comment do not include headlines or captions in the traditional sense. This principle would apply to the original Crux article about Gladding's allegations (reviewed separately).

**Findings:**
Not applicable to this specific material.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Concerns About Crux's Editorial Stance

**Analysis:**

**Crux's Adversarial Position:**
Crux's comment reveals a potentially problematic editorial stance:

"It's not enough for you and other councillors to 'tell' the community things - we need documentary proof, because QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past. And that's a fact." (lines 49-50)

This statement reveals:
1. **Predetermined Credibility Assessment**: Crux has decided QLDC sources are not credible ("failed to tell the truth")
2. **Adversarial Relationship**: The tone is confrontational rather than neutral journalistic inquiry
3. **Double Standard**: Demanding proof from Mayor while having published Gladding's allegations without such proof
4. **Appearance of Bias**: Suggests Crux may favor opposition/critic voices over official sources

**Electoral Context:**
During an election period, such an adversarial stance toward incumbent officials while providing platforms for challengers creates potential conflicts:
- If Crux has predetermined that QLDC officials are not credible, can they provide fair electoral coverage?
- Has this stance influenced their editorial decisions about which candidates receive favorable coverage?
- Are challengers' claims subjected to the same skepticism as incumbents' responses?

**Disclosure:**
There is no disclosure of:
- Crux's relationship with Gladding or other candidates
- Whether Crux has institutional positions on QLDC governance issues
- What "QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past" specifically refers to
- Whether Crux's editorial stance might affect coverage balance

**Evidence:**

Crux's statement of institutional position:
"QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past. And that's a fact." (line 50) - This broad institutional position against QLDC credibility should be disclosed as context for their coverage.

Demanding different standards:
"we need documentary proof" (line 49) - This standard was apparently not applied to Gladding's allegations that prompted the Mayor's response.

**Findings:**
Crux's comment reveals an institutional stance that QLDC officials are not credible. While investigative skepticism is appropriate journalism, during an election period such a predetermined position creates potential conflicts of interest:
1. It may bias coverage toward challengers/critics over incumbents
2. It creates appearance that Crux is advocating for particular electoral outcomes
3. It should be disclosed so readers can evaluate coverage with this context

This raises questions about whether Crux's election coverage serves watchdog journalism or advocacy for particular political positions.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The Mayor's post and Crux's comment deal entirely with public officials and public matters. No privacy issues arise.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The content does not raise issues related to discrimination or diversity. The discussion focuses on governance processes and political accountability.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this content.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Relevant Context

The Mayor's post references Gladding's breach of confidentiality:
"Niki shared confidential information and then used this confidential information to aid a third party - Aotearoa Water Action (AWA), which she is heavily involved with - in legal proceedings against the Council. The judgment of the Environment Court confirmed the information was indeed confidential. (Refer Decision No. [2025] NZEnvC 97)" (lines 37-38)

This is relevant context for evaluating the original opinion piece. If Gladding was removed from committees for breaching confidentiality (confirmed by court decision), this context should have been included in balanced coverage of her allegations.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

No subterfuge issues arise in this content.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No photographs or graphics are included in the text provided.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Concerns:**

This review focuses primarily on what the Mayor's Facebook post and Crux's response reveal about the broader coverage pattern, rather than the Facebook post itself (which is political speech not subject to NZMC standards).

**Key Concerns Identified:**

1. **Lack of Balance in Original Coverage:** The Mayor's detailed Facebook rebuttal suggests he was not given opportunity for right of reply before Crux published Gladding's allegations. This would constitute a breach of Principle 1.

2. **Double Standards in Fact-Checking:** Crux demands "documentary proof" from the Mayor while having published Gladding's allegations without such verification. This reveals selective application of journalistic standards.

3. **Fact vs. Opinion Issues:** The Mayor's rebuttal reveals numerous claims in the "opinion piece" that he characterizes as factually incorrect, suggesting the original article may have blurred fact and opinion.

4. **Inadequate Factual Foundation:** The Mayor provides specific facts (committee composition, procurement procedures, court decisions, councillor verification) that appear to contradict the published opinion piece, suggesting inadequate factual foundation.

5. **Institutional Bias:** Crux's statement that "QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past" reveals a predetermined institutional stance that may compromise fair electoral coverage.

6. **Electoral Fairness:** The pattern suggests unequal treatment of electoral competitors, with challengers/critics receiving platforms without rigorous fact-checking while incumbents' responses are met with skepticism and demands for proof.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

Several concerning patterns emerge from this exchange:

1. **Unequal Access to Platform:**
   - Gladding gets substantial Crux platform to make allegations
   - Mayor must respond via Facebook rather than being given equal Crux space
   - Crux engages with Mayor's Facebook post via comment rather than offering article platform

2. **Asymmetric Verification Standards:**
   - Gladding's allegations published without apparent verification
   - Mayor's rebuttal met with demands for "documentary proof"
   - No acknowledgment from Crux that they should have verified before publishing

3. **Adversarial vs. Advocacy Journalism:**
   - Crux appears adversarial toward QLDC officials
   - Potentially advocacy-oriented toward QLDC critics
   - Predetermined credibility assessments rather than neutral inquiry

4. **Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**
   - "Opinion piece" contained factual claims requiring verification
   - Mayor's rebuttal provides contradictory facts from verifiable sources
   - Crux's response doesn't acknowledge the factual disputes, just demands more proof

5. **Electoral Period Responsibilities:**
   - During elections, media has heightened responsibility for balance
   - Pattern suggests systematic advantage for certain political perspectives
   - May affect voter access to balanced information for democratic choice

---

**Electoral Context:**

This exchange during an election period raises serious concerns about fair electoral coverage:

1. **Unequal Campaign Platforms:**
   - If Gladding received Crux platform for allegations without Mayor receiving equal right of reply, this creates unfair electoral advantage
   - Mayor relegated to Facebook for response, which may reach different/smaller audience
   - Other mayoral candidates also referenced as supporting Gladding's claims (line 6) - were they all given platforms?

2. **Voter Information Quality:**
   - Voters reading only Crux coverage would receive Gladding's allegations without Mayor's rebuttal
   - Factual disputes remain unresolved if Crux doesn't provide balanced coverage
   - Undermines informed voter choice

3. **Media Role in Democracy:**
   - NZMC preamble states "An independent press plays a vital role in a democracy"
   - Fair electoral coverage is essential to democratic function
   - Pattern suggests media advocacy rather than neutral information provision

4. **Compounding Effect:**
   - Original imbalanced article published September 3, 2025
   - Mayor's Facebook response September 24, 2025 - 21 days later
   - Crux comment questions Mayor's credibility rather than acknowledging coverage gap
   - Pattern may continue through election period

---

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

While the Mayor's Facebook post itself cannot be subject of NZMC complaint (it's not published content), the broader pattern of coverage can and should be addressed.

**Primary Complaint Focus:**

**Original Niki Gladding Opinion Piece (September 3, 2025)** - Should be complained about for:

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**:
   - No right of reply given to Mayor before publishing allegations about his leadership and actions
   - No balance from other councillors, CE, or others criticized
   - Factual claims made without verification (contradicted by Mayor's rebuttal with specific facts)

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**:
   - Opinion piece contained factual claims requiring verification
   - Insufficient distinction between Gladding's opinions and factual assertions
   - Material facts underlying opinions appear inaccurate based on Mayor's rebuttal

3. **Principle 5 - Foundation of Fact**:
   - Even as opinion, piece lacked adequate factual foundation
   - Contradictory facts apparently available from sitting councillors, court records, and public documents
   - No evidence these were checked before publication

4. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**:
   - Electoral context not adequately disclosed and balanced
   - Substantial campaign benefit to Gladding without equal opportunity for criticized parties

**Supporting Evidence from This Exchange:**

Use the Mayor's Facebook post to demonstrate:

1. **Specific Factual Contradictions:**
   - Procurement process: Mayor provides detailed procedural facts contradicting allegations
   - Councillor support: Four councillors confirmed process proper - were they consulted?
   - Court decision: Environment Court Decision No. [2025] NZEnvC 97 confirmed confidentiality - cited in original?
   - Regional Deals: Mayor clarifies structure - was this basic fact checked?

2. **Lack of Right of Reply:**
   - Mayor felt compelled to respond via Facebook, suggesting no Crux right of reply offered
   - 21-day gap between publication and Mayor's response
   - Crux engaged via Facebook comment rather than offering article platform

3. **Double Standards:**
   - Crux's demand for "documentary proof" from Mayor
   - No evidence same standard applied to Gladding's original allegations
   - Reveals selective application of journalistic rigor

4. **Institutional Bias:**
   - Crux's statement "QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past"
   - Suggests predetermined credibility assessment affecting coverage decisions
   - Undisclosed editorial stance potentially influencing electoral coverage

**Additional Complaints to Consider:**

**Crux's Comment Response (September 24, 2025):**

If Crux's Facebook comment is published on their platform or represents their editorial position:

1. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**:
   - States "QLDC sources have failed to tell the truth in the past. And that's a fact" without evidence
   - Presents serious allegation about dishonesty as established fact without substantiation

2. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**:
   - Reveals undisclosed editorial bias against QLDC official sources
   - Should be disclosed in coverage so readers can evaluate objectivity

**Pattern Complaint:**

If there are multiple Crux articles showing similar pattern:
- Consider complaint about series of articles creating systematic electoral imbalance
- Document all instances of challengers receiving platforms without balance
- Show pattern of different standards for incumbents vs. challengers

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Timing is Critical**:
   - Today (October 3, 2025) is the one-month deadline for complaining about September 3 article
   - Immediate action required if complaint is to be pursued
   - Cannot be delayed without seeking extension from NZMC Chair

2. **Standing - Who Should Complain:**
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers (directly criticized, denied right of reply)
   - CE Mike Theelen (criticized in original article)
   - Other councillors (characterized negatively)
   - Community member concerned about fair electoral coverage
   - NZMC may require consent from affected individuals if third-party complaint

3. **Public Interest Justification:**
   - Protecting electoral integrity and fair campaign coverage
   - Ensuring voters receive balanced information for democratic choice
   - Establishing standards for electoral journalism in New Zealand
   - Protecting public officials from unfair attacks during elections
   - Holding media accountable during critical democratic periods

4. **Crux's History:**
   - ReviewContext.MD notes "Crux has a histroy of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council"
   - Previous NZMC rulings against Crux may be relevant precedent
   - Pattern of behavior may influence NZMC assessment
   - Should review previous complaints/rulings for similar issues

5. **Electoral Impact Assessment:**
   - Original article published early in campaign (September 3)
   - Mayor's response via Facebook 21 days later (September 24)
   - Voters who read only Crux received one-sided information during critical period
   - Electoral harm may be difficult to remedy if complaint delayed until after election
   - Urgent action serves democratic integrity

6. **Media Accountability:**
   - This complaint serves broader purpose of establishing electoral journalism standards
   - Crux's response reveals need for clearer industry standards about:
     - Equal application of fact-checking standards
     - Disclosure of editorial positions during elections
     - Right of reply timing and prominence
     - Distinction between watchdog journalism and political advocacy

7. **Potential Challenges:**
   - Crux may claim "opinion" exempts from balance requirements
   - May argue Mayor could have contacted them for right of reply
   - May claim their skepticism of QLDC is legitimate watchdog journalism
   - Will need to show why these defenses don't apply during elections with factual claims requiring verification

8. **Coordination with Other Potential Complainants:**
   - If CE, other councillors, or multiple community members are concerned
   - Multiple complaints on same article strengthens case
   - Shows broad concern about coverage fairness
   - NZMC may consider pattern more seriously with multiple complainants

While the Mayor's Facebook post itself is political speech not subject to NZMC review, it provides crucial evidence about the original Crux coverage pattern. The exchange reveals:

1. **Likely Balance Breach**: Mayor's need to respond via Facebook suggests no right of reply in original Crux article
2. **Double Standards**: Crux demands proof from Mayor while having published unverified allegations
3. **Fact/Opinion Issues**: "Opinion piece" contained factual claims now contradicted with specific evidence
4. **Institutional Bias**: Crux's revealed stance against QLDC credibility may compromise fair coverage
5. **Electoral Harm**: Pattern creates unfair advantage during democratic election period

The original Niki Gladding opinion piece (September 3, 2025) should be the subject of formal NZMC complaint for breaching Principles 1, 4, 5, and 10. This complaint must be filed with Crux TODAY (October 3, 2025) to meet the one-month deadline.

The complaint serves not only to address this specific coverage but to establish important precedents for electoral journalism standards, ensuring media fulfills its democratic role of providing balanced information rather than advocacy for particular political positions.

**URGENT ACTION REQUIRED**: Complaint to publisher must be submitted by end of day October 3, 2025.
