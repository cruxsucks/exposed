# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Councillor Alexa Forbes
**Publication:** Crux
**Date:** September 29, 2025
**Author:** Crux (comment response to Alexa Forbes' post)
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This article consists of a Facebook post by QLDC Councillor Alexa Forbes regarding the local election campaign, followed by a lengthy comment response from Crux. The Crux response contains serious allegations against multiple named individuals (Mayor Boult, Mayor Lewers, CEO Meaghan Miller) and council staff, presented as fact without supporting evidence or right of reply. Multiple NZMC principles appear to have been breached, particularly regarding accuracy, fairness and balance (Principle 1), and the distinction between fact and comment (Principle 4).

---

## Article Summary
The article is structured in two parts:

**Part 1: Alexa Forbes' Post (lines 1-5)**
Forbes, a QLDC councillor, shares her thoughts on the local election campaign, expressing concern about personal attacks on Mayor Glyn Lewers. She advocates for holding the mayor accountable on policy and delivery rather than personal attacks, and states she won't vote for anyone who personally attacks.

**Part 2: Crux Response (lines 7-8)**
A response attributed to "Crux" (the publication itself) makes serious allegations including:
- Claims of "blatant disregard for truth, integrity and public service" by Mayor Boult, Mayor Lewers, and CEO Meaghan Miller
- Allegations that "multiple council staff, from the top down lied about procurement and jobs for mates"
- Claims of "illegal dumping of partially treated sewage" that was "denied by the mayor, local MP, CEO and senior engineering staff"
- Accusations that Mayor Boult, Mayor Lewers, and council executives Theelen and Miller use tactics to "Delay, Deny, Defend" - compared to insurance company tactics from McKinsey consultants
- Characterization of Forbes' position as naive ("let's be friends with everyone" and "dream on!")

The Crux response presents these serious allegations as established facts without providing supporting evidence, documentation, or right of reply to those accused.

---

## Context Considerations
The ReviewContext.MD file indicates:
- The Queenstown Lakes local government elections are underway
- Crux is a local news site reporting on QLDC matters
- Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council

This electoral context is critical. The article is published during an active election period where Mayor Lewers is presumably seeking re-election. The serious allegations made by Crux against Lewers and other officials could significantly impact electoral outcomes.

Additionally, this appears to be published on Crux's platform as a response to a councillor's social media post, creating questions about editorial control and the appropriate role of a news organization in making direct allegations against public officials.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**
The Crux response makes multiple serious factual claims without providing supporting evidence:

1. **"Multiple council staff, from the top down lied about procurement and jobs for mates"** (line 8) - This is an allegation of criminal conduct (lying in official capacity) presented as fact without:
   - Specification of which procurement processes
   - Evidence of the alleged lies
   - Documentation of the "jobs for mates"
   - Any investigative findings or official determinations

2. **"Hundreds of LGOIMA requests eventually proved that..."** (line 8) - Claims LGOIMA requests "proved" lying, but:
   - No LGOIMA responses are cited or linked
   - No specific documents are referenced
   - No independent verification of what was "proved"

3. **"Long standing illegal dumping of partially treated sewage"** (line 8) - Alleges illegal activity:
   - No citation of which law was violated
   - No reference to environmental reports or regulatory findings
   - No specification of dates, locations, or duration

4. **"Denied by the mayor, local MP, CEO and senior engineering staff"** (line 8) - Alleges a cover-up:
   - No quotes or documentation of the alleged denials
   - No context about what information was available at what time
   - No acknowledgment that officials may have had different information or legitimate reasons for their statements

5. **McKinsey "Delay, Deny, Defend" comparison** (line 8) - Presents controversial consulting advice as fact:
   - No citation for the McKinsey advice referenced
   - No evidence that these specific individuals used these tactics
   - Inflammatory comparison without factual foundation

These are serious allegations of dishonesty, illegality, and corruption presented as established facts without the standard of evidence required for such claims.

**Fairness Issues:**
The article is fundamentally unfair to those accused:

- **Mayor Glyn Lewers** - Accused of "blatant disregard for truth, integrity and public service" and using "Delay, Deny, Defend" tactics without opportunity to respond
- **Former Mayor Jim Boult** - Similarly accused without right of reply
- **CEO Meaghan Miller** - Named as "ever present" in misconduct without opportunity to respond
- **CEO Mike Theelen** - Accused of lying and using obstructionist tactics without right of reply
- **Local MP** - Accused of denying illegal sewage dumping without being named or given opportunity to respond
- **Senior engineering staff** - Collectively accused of lying without identification or right of reply

None of these individuals were given opportunity to respond to serious allegations of dishonesty, illegality, and corruption.

**Balance Issues:**
The article provides no balance:
- No response from any accused party
- No independent verification of allegations
- No alternative perspectives on the issues raised
- No acknowledgment of complexity in wastewater management or LGOIMA processes
- No recognition that Forbes' original post defended the mayor, creating irony in Crux attacking him in response

The Crux response functions as an editorial attack on multiple public officials during an election period, without providing any of the fairness or balance required for such serious allegations.

**Evidence:**

"You know my background and in a global career I never seen such blatant disregard for truth, integrity and public service as at QLDC under Boult, Lewers and the ever present Meaghan Miller." (line 8) - Serious character allegations presented as fact based solely on author's assertion.

"Hundreds of LGOIMA requests eventually proved that multiple council staff, from the top down lied about procurement and jobs for mates" (line 8) - Allegation of lying (potential criminal conduct) without citation of proof.

"For months in 2024/2025 the tragic and long standing illegal dumping of partially treated sewage was denied by the mayor, local MP, CEO and senior engineering staff." (line 8) - Allegation of illegal activity and cover-up without supporting evidence.

"Mayor Boult, Lewers, council bosses Theelen and Miller use the famous and deadly global advice to the insurance companies from consultants Mackinsey on how to increase their already huge profits - Delay, Deny, Defend." (line 8) - Inflammatory comparison without factual foundation or right of reply.

**Findings:**
This article constitutes a clear breach of Principle 1. It makes serious allegations of dishonesty, illegality, and corruption against multiple named individuals without providing supporting evidence or right of reply. The timing during an election period makes this breach particularly serious, as these unsubstantiated allegations could significantly impact electoral outcomes. The article fails to meet basic standards of accuracy (providing evidence for serious allegations), fairness (giving those accused opportunity to respond), and balance (providing alternative perspectives or acknowledging complexity).

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The Crux response systematically fails to distinguish between factual information and opinion/interpretation:

**Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**

1. **"Blatant disregard for truth, integrity and public service"** (line 8) - This is a subjective characterization presented as fact. Whether conduct shows "blatant disregard" is opinion; what specific conduct occurred is fact. The article provides the former without the latter.

2. **"Lied about procurement and jobs for mates"** (line 8) - "Lied" implies intentional dishonesty, which is opinion/interpretation. Facts would be: specific statements made, evidence those statements were false, evidence of intent to deceive.

3. **"Illegal dumping of partially treated sewage"** (line 8) - Whether wastewater discharge was "illegal" is a legal conclusion requiring citation to violated laws and regulatory determinations. Presented as fact without legal foundation.

4. **"Delay, Deny, Defend"** (line 8) - This characterization of officials' behavior is opinion, not fact. Specific actions and their timing would be facts; whether they constitute obstructionist tactics is interpretation.

**Lack of Clear Identification:**
The Crux response is not clearly labeled as opinion or editorial. It appears as a comment from the publication itself, creating ambiguity about whether this represents:
- Editorial position
- Reporter's personal view
- News organization's official stance
- Individual blogger's opinion

The attribution to "Crux" (the publication name) rather than a named individual suggests this is meant as the organization's position, which heightens the responsibility for factual accuracy and fairness.

**Factual Foundation:**
The response makes sweeping claims without proper factual foundation:

- Claims "hundreds of LGOIMA requests" prove misconduct - but doesn't cite specific requests or responses
- References "months in 2024/2025" for sewage issue - but provides no dates, reports, or documentation
- Claims knowledge of "global career" comparisons - but provides no specific examples or evidence
- References McKinsey consulting advice - but provides no citation or verification

These opinions lack the "foundation of fact" required even for clearly-identified opinion content under Principle 5.

**Evidence:**

"Sadly Alexa things are far more serious than you like to think." (line 8) - Opinion about severity presented as corrective fact.

"It's not my imagination either - hundreds of LGOIMA requests eventually proved that multiple council staff, from the top down lied" (line 8) - Claims factual proof without providing evidence or citations.

"NZ can't be the 'land of no consequences' unless it wants to sink gradually into corruption and obscurity." (line 8) - Opinion about societal direction presented as factual conclusion.

"Your 'let's be friends with everyone' is laudable in theory - but in the real world, especially the Southern Lakes where Big Money comes face to face every day with a fragile natural environment, I'm sorry but dream on!" (line 8) - Dismissive characterization of Forbes' position as naive.

The entire response conflates the author's strong opinions about council conduct with factual allegations, without providing the evidence necessary to substantiate the factual claims or clearly identifying what is opinion versus fact.

**Findings:**
The article breaches Principle 4 by failing to distinguish between factual information and opinion. Serious allegations of dishonesty, illegality, and corruption are presented as established facts without supporting evidence or clear identification as the author's interpretations/opinions. The lack of attribution to a specific individual (using "Crux" as the author) makes the confusion worse, as it's unclear whether this represents editorial opinion or purported factual reporting. The article should have either: (1) provided comprehensive evidence for factual allegations, or (2) clearly labeled content as opinion and moderated allegations to reflect they are interpretations rather than established facts.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "Councillor Alexa Forbes"

This is a simple, neutral headline that accurately identifies the subject of the article - Alexa Forbes' post and the response to it. The headline does not misrepresent the content or make unsupported claims.

However, it should be noted that the headline is somewhat misleading by omission:
- It suggests the article is about Forbes or by Forbes
- It does not indicate the article contains serious allegations by Crux against council officials
- It does not signal the controversial editorial nature of the Crux response

A more accurate headline might have been:
- "Crux responds to Councillor Forbes on election conduct"
- "Councillor Forbes defends mayor; Crux alleges council corruption"
- "Forbes calls for civil campaign; Crux makes serious allegations against officials"

**Evidence:**

Headline: "Councillor Alexa Forbes" (title of article)

**Findings:**
While the headline is technically accurate (the article does involve Councillor Forbes), it is misleading by omission. It suggests a straightforward article about or by Forbes, when the substantial content is actually Crux making serious allegations against other officials. However, this falls short of a clear breach of Principle 6, which requires headlines to "accurately and fairly convey the substance or a key element of the report." The headline does identify a key element (Forbes' involvement), even if it doesn't convey the more controversial substance (Crux's allegations). Assessment: Compliant but misleading.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**
The Crux response is not clearly identified as opinion content. It appears as a comment attributed to "Crux" (the publication itself) in response to a councillor's post. There is no label such as "Editorial," "Opinion," "Comment," or "Publisher's Note" that would signal to readers this is opinion rather than news reporting.

The context is particularly important: this appears to be published on Crux's own platform or social media, responding to content from a public official. Readers might reasonably interpret this as the publication's official news position rather than clearly-identified opinion.

**Foundation of Fact:**
Even if treated as opinion content, the Crux response has serious weaknesses in factual foundation:

- **LGOIMA claims**: References "hundreds of LGOIMA requests" that "proved" misconduct but provides no specific requests, responses, or findings
- **Sewage allegations**: Claims "illegal dumping" occurred for "months in 2024/2025" but provides no documentation, regulatory findings, or environmental reports
- **Lying allegations**: Accuses specific named individuals of lying but provides no evidence of false statements or intent to deceive
- **McKinsey reference**: Cites "famous" consulting advice but provides no source or verification
- **Procurement claims**: Alleges "jobs for mates" but provides no specific examples or evidence

Principle 5 states: "Though requirements for a foundation of fact pertain, with comment and opinion balance is not essential." This response fails the foundation-of-fact requirement even for opinion content.

**Balance Requirement:**
While Principle 5 notes "with comment and opinion balance is not essential," this protection only applies to clearly-identified opinion content with proper factual foundation. This response has neither clear identification nor factual foundation, so it cannot claim exemption from balance requirements.

**Evidence:**

Attribution: "Crux" (line 7) - Not attributed to a named opinion columnist or clearly labeled as editorial opinion.

Format: Appears as direct response/comment to Forbes' post - not presented in standard opinion column format with byline, photo, and "Opinion" label.

Factual claims without support: "Hundreds of LGOIMA requests eventually proved that multiple council staff, from the top down lied about procurement and jobs for mates" (line 8) - Makes factual claim without providing foundation.

Personal attack on Forbes: "Your 'let's be friends with everyone' is laudable in theory - but in the real world... dream on!" (line 8) - Dismissive and personal without being clearly framed as opinion column discourse.

**Findings:**
The Crux response constitutes a breach of Principle 5. If this content were clearly identified as an opinion column or editorial with proper byline and labeling, some of the balance concerns might be mitigated (though the lack of factual foundation would remain problematic). However, because it appears as a direct comment from the publication without clear identification as opinion content, it cannot claim the protections of Principle 5. Additionally, even opinion content requires a foundation of fact, which this response lacks for its serious allegations. The response should have been either: (1) clearly labeled as editorial opinion with named author, or (2) held to news reporting standards with evidence and right of reply.

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Electoral Context:**
This article is published during an election period where Mayor Lewers and potentially others named are seeking office. The serious allegations made against Lewers could significantly impact electoral outcomes:
- Claims he has "blatant disregard for truth, integrity and public service"
- Allegations he uses "Delay, Deny, Defend" tactics
- Accusations of covering up illegal sewage dumping
- Claims he and other officials lied about procurement

These allegations, published without evidence or right of reply during an election, could function as electoral interference.

**Disclosure Requirements:**
The article should disclose:
- That this is published during an active election period
- Whether Crux or its principals have any relationships with candidates
- Whether Crux has political positions in the election
- The potential electoral impact of making serious unsubstantiated allegations

**Publication's Role:**
A particularly concerning aspect is that "Crux" itself (the publication) is making these allegations, not a named journalist or columnist. This raises questions:
- Does Crux have a political agenda in this election?
- Is Crux using its platform to influence electoral outcomes?
- Does Crux have any conflicts of interest with candidates or issues?
- Why is the publication directly attacking public officials rather than reporting news?

The ReviewContext.MD notes that "Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council," suggesting a pattern that may be relevant to assessing conflicts of interest.

**Author-Subject Relationship:**
By responding directly to Forbes' post, Crux creates a confrontational relationship with a sitting councillor. This raises questions:
- Does Crux have ongoing conflicts with Forbes or her positions?
- Is Crux using this response to advance particular electoral outcomes?
- What is Crux's editorial policy on directly attacking public officials in comments?

**Evidence:**

Attribution to "Crux" (line 7) - The publication itself making allegations, not a named journalist or columnist.

Direct contradiction of Forbes: Forbes defends the mayor and calls for civil discourse; Crux immediately attacks the mayor with serious allegations - suggesting possible political agenda.

Timing during election: Published September 29, 2025, during active local government elections where individuals attacked are presumably candidates.

Personal attack on Forbes: "Your 'let's be friends with everyone' is laudable in theory - but in the real world... dream on!" (line 8) - Suggests antagonistic relationship between publication and councillor.

Reference to Crux's own history: "Journalism will disappear unless we hold power to account - and my god it's not easy against a well resourced council that won't respect the fourth estate or the community." (line 8) - Positions Crux as adversary of council, raising questions about objectivity.

**Findings:**
The article constitutes a potential breach of Principle 10 by failing to disclose potential conflicts of interest and the electoral context of serious allegations. A news publication using its own voice (rather than a named columnist) to make serious unsubstantiated allegations against public officials during an election raises significant questions about conflicts of interest, political agenda, and appropriate use of media power. At minimum, the article should have disclosed: (1) the electoral context and timing, (2) any relationships or positions Crux has with candidates or issues, (3) the rationale for the publication itself making allegations rather than reporting news. The adversarial tone and reference to council not respecting "the fourth estate" suggests possible conflict that should be disclosed to readers.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise privacy concerns. All individuals named (Mayor Boult, Mayor Lewers, CEO Meaghan Miller, CEO Mike Theelen, Forbes) are public officials engaged in public roles. The matters discussed relate to public council business and governance, which are clearly matters of public interest and public record.

However, it should be noted that while privacy is not breached, reputation is seriously impacted. The allegations of dishonesty, illegal conduct, and corruption - whether true or false - could significantly harm the professional and personal reputations of named individuals. While this doesn't constitute a privacy breach, it heightens the importance of accuracy, fairness, and right of reply under other principles.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical/mental disability. While the article involves several individuals, their personal characteristics are not gratuitously emphasized or made relevant to the allegations.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article does not appear to rely on confidential sources. The Crux response references LGOIMA requests (public information requests) and speaks from apparent personal knowledge. No confidentiality issues arise, though the lack of source citation for serious allegations is problematic under other principles.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. The response appears to be based on publicly available information (LGOIMA requests) and the author's observations.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text provided does not include photographs or graphics details. Cannot assess from available information.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The Crux response makes serious allegations of dishonesty, illegal conduct, and corruption against multiple named individuals without providing supporting evidence or right of reply. The allegations include: lying about procurement, illegal sewage dumping, cover-ups, and use of obstructionist tactics. None of the accused individuals were given opportunity to respond. During an election period, these unsubstantiated allegations could significantly impact electoral outcomes while denying fairness to those attacked.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The Crux response fails to distinguish between factual information and opinion. Serious allegations of dishonesty and illegal conduct are presented as established facts without evidence. Subjective characterizations ("blatant disregard," "lied," "illegal") are presented as factual conclusions rather than interpretations. The response lacks clear identification as opinion and conflates opinion with factual allegations throughout.

3. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - BREACH**: The Crux response is not clearly identified as opinion content, appearing instead as a direct comment from the publication. Even if treated as opinion, the response lacks the required foundation of fact, making serious allegations without supporting documentation or evidence. The response cannot claim exemption from balance requirements because it is not clearly identified as opinion and lacks factual foundation.

4. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article fails to disclose the electoral context and potential conflicts of interest. Published during an election period, the serious allegations against officials who are presumably candidates could significantly impact electoral outcomes. The publication using its own voice (rather than a named columnist) to attack officials raises questions about political agenda and conflicts of interest that should be disclosed to readers.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This article exhibits several concerning patterns:

1. **Publication as Protagonist**: Rather than reporting news, Crux itself appears as a protagonist - directly attacking public officials, defending its own adversarial relationship with council ("well resourced council that won't respect the fourth estate"), and positioning itself as a crusader against corruption. This blurs the line between journalism and advocacy.

2. **Allegations Without Evidence**: The response makes serious allegations (lying, illegal conduct, cover-ups) without providing the evidence necessary to substantiate such claims. References to "hundreds of LGOIMA requests" that "proved" misconduct are not supported by citations, documents, or specific examples.

3. **Personal Attacks**: The response personally attacks both the officials criticized (accusing them of corruption) and the councillor who posted (dismissing her view as naive: "dream on!"). This confrontational approach undermines credibility and fairness.

4. **Electoral Timing**: Published during an election period, the serious unsubstantiated allegations could significantly impact electoral outcomes. This raises questions about whether Crux is using its platform to influence elections rather than inform voters.

5. **Institutional Voice**: By attributing the response to "Crux" rather than a named individual, the publication commits its institutional credibility to serious allegations without the evidence or fairness that should accompany such institutional positions.

The ReviewContext.MD notes that "Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council," suggesting this may be part of a broader pattern of breaching standards.

---

**Electoral Context:**

This article's publication during an election period has several critical implications:

1. **Electoral Impact**: The serious allegations against Mayor Lewers (and potentially other candidates) could significantly impact his electoral prospects. Allegations of "blatant disregard for truth, integrity and public service," lying, and covering up illegal conduct are devastating attacks on a candidate's character and fitness for office.

2. **Timing Advantage**: Published September 29, 2025, late in the campaign period, the allegations may be timed to impact the election while minimizing opportunity for response or fact-checking before voting concludes.

3. **Unsubstantiated Electoral Interference**: By making serious allegations without evidence or right of reply during an election, Crux potentially interferes with the electoral process. Voters may be influenced by unsubstantiated allegations presented as facts.

4. **Violation of Electoral Fairness**: Fair election coverage requires either:
   - Balance (presenting multiple candidates' perspectives)
   - Evidence (supporting serious allegations with documentation)
   - Right of reply (allowing accused to respond)
   - Clear labeling (identifying content as opinion or advocacy)

   This article achieves none of these.

5. **Ironic Context**: Forbes' original post defended Mayor Lewers and called for accountability on policy rather than personal attacks. Crux's response does exactly what Forbes argued against - making personal attacks during an election. This irony highlights the inappropriate nature of the response.

6. **Voter Deception**: Voters encountering this content may believe they are reading factual journalism from a news organization when they are actually reading unsubstantiated allegations that function as electoral attacks. This undermines informed democratic choice.

The electoral context transforms what would already be serious principle breaches into potential electoral interference that could affect democratic outcomes.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are strong grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The Crux response fails to provide supporting evidence for serious allegations and denies right of reply to those accused. Specific grounds:

   - Adversarial relationship between Crux and council not disclosed
   - Potential electoral impact not acknowledged

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Lack of Evidence for Serious Allegations:**

   - Multiple named individuals accused of serious misconduct (Mayor Boult, Mayor Lewers, CEO Miller, CEO Theelen, senior engineering staff, local MP) without any being given opportunity to respond
   - Allegations of lying, illegal conduct, cover-ups presented without opportunity for accused to provide context or defense

3. **Opinion Presented as Fact:**
   - "In a global career I never seen such blatant disregard for truth, integrity and public service as at QLDC under Boult, Lewers and the ever present Meaghan Miller" (line 8) - Subjective opinion presented as factual assessment
   - "It's not my imagination either - hundreds of LGOIMA requests eventually proved..." (line 8) - Claims factual proof without providing evidence

4. **Lack of Clear Labeling:**
   - Attribution to "Crux" (line 7) rather than named columnist or clear editorial label
   - No identification as opinion, editorial, or commentary content
   - Appears as direct comment from publication without clear labeling

5. **Electoral Context Not Disclosed:**
   - Serious allegations against officials during election period without disclosure of electoral timing

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of the decision with fair prominence

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for:
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers
   - Former Mayor Jim Boult
   - CEO Meaghan Miller
   - CEO Mike Theelen
   - Senior engineering staff collectively or individually
   - Local MP (if identifiable)

   To be given fair prominence similar to original allegations

4. **Correction/Retraction**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Allegations were made without supporting evidence or documentation
   - Those accused were not given opportunity to respond
   - Claims about "proof" from LGOIMA requests were not substantiated with citations
   - Allegations of illegal conduct were not supported by regulatory findings
   - Content should have been clearly labeled as opinion if not held to news standards
   - Electoral context should have been disclosed

5. **Apology**: Request apology to individuals whose reputations were damaged by serious unsubstantiated allegations of lying, illegal conduct, and corruption

6. **Process Improvements**: Request Crux establish clear editorial policies for:
   - Distinguishing news reporting from editorial opinion
   - Requiring evidence before making serious allegations
   - Mandatory right of reply when individuals are accused of misconduct
   - Clear labeling of opinion, editorial, and commentary content
   - Disclosure of electoral context during campaign periods
   - Appropriate attribution (named authors rather than institutional voice for opinions)

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Timing is Critical**: The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher is October 29, 2025. Given today is October 3, 2025, there is time but action should be taken promptly.

2. **Public Interest**: This complaint serves public interest by:
   - Protecting electoral integrity and fair campaign coverage
   - Preventing media from making unsubstantiated allegations against public officials
   - Ensuring news organizations distinguish between journalism and advocacy
   - Protecting reputations from serious accusations without evidence
   - Upholding standards for accuracy and fairness in local journalism

3. **Standing**: Consider who should bring complaint:
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers (directly accused of serious misconduct)
   - Former Mayor Jim Boult (directly accused)
   - CEO Meaghan Miller (directly accused)
   - CEO Mike Theelen (directly accused)
   - Any of the "senior engineering staff" accused
   - Councillor Alexa Forbes (her post was used as platform for attacks, and she was personally dismissed as naive)
   - Community member concerned about journalistic standards and electoral fairness
   - NZMC will consider third-party complaints but may require consent from affected individuals

4. **Pattern Evidence**: If pursuing complaint, investigate whether:
   - Crux has made similar unsubstantiated allegations in other articles
   - The ReviewContext.MD reference to "history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council" reveals relevant precedents
   - This is part of a pattern of Crux using its platform for advocacy rather than journalism
   - Other election coverage shows similar breaches

5. **Electoral Impact**: Document potential electoral impact:
   - Timing of publication (late September during election campaign)
   - Severity of allegations (dishonesty, illegal conduct, corruption)
   - Reach of Crux publication in Queenstown-Wanaka area
   - Whether allegations have been repeated or amplified in other coverage
   - Impact on public perception of accused officials as candidates

6. **Unique Aspects**: This case has unusual features:
   - Publication itself (not a named columnist) making serious allegations
   - Direct response format (responding to councillor's social media post)
   - Ironic context (Forbes defended officials; Crux attacked them in response)
   - Adversarial framing (Crux positioning itself as crusader against corrupt council)
   - Reference to publication's own struggles ("my god it's not easy against a well resourced council")

These unique aspects strengthen the case that Crux has crossed the line from journalism into advocacy/activism without proper disclosure or adherence to standards.

**Conclusion:**

This article represents a serious failure of journalistic standards. A news publication using its own institutional voice to make serious unsubstantiated allegations of dishonesty, illegal conduct, and corruption against multiple named individuals during an election period - without providing evidence or right of reply - breaches fundamental principles of accuracy, fairness, and balance.

The Crux response appears to function as advocacy or activism rather than journalism, positioning the publication as a crusader against corruption while making serious allegations without the evidence required to substantiate such claims. The failure to distinguish between fact and opinion, the lack of clear labeling as opinion content, and the absence of disclosure about electoral context and potential conflicts compound the breaches.

Most concerning is the electoral context: publishing devastating unsubstantiated allegations against officials who are presumably election candidates could significantly impact electoral outcomes while denying voters the balanced, evidence-based information necessary for informed democratic choice.

A formal complaint is warranted and should be pursued promptly. The complaint serves not only to address this specific article but to establish important precedents about:
- News organizations distinguishing between journalism and advocacy
- Requirements for evidence before making serious allegations
- Mandatory right of reply for those accused of misconduct
- Clear labeling of opinion versus news content
- Disclosure of electoral context and conflicts of interest
- Appropriate use of institutional voice versus individual columnists

The one-month deadline for complaining to the publisher (October 29, 2025) requires prompt action by any affected individuals or concerned community members.
