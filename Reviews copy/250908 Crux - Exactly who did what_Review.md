**Publication:** Crux
**Date:** September 8, 2025
**Author:** Peter Newport
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This article purports to provide factual information about councillor votes on Niki Gladding's removal from QLDC committee roles. However, it contains serious inaccuracies, misleading framing, and biased characterization of events during an election period when multiple councillors are seeking re-election. The article breaches NZMC principles regarding accuracy, fairness and balance (Principle 1), distinction between fact and comment (Principle 4), and headline accuracy (Principle 6). The article presents a highly partisan narrative that casts Gladding as a whistleblowing hero and other councillors as complicit wrongdoers, without providing balance or right of reply.

---

## Article Summary
The article is structured as a factual account responding to reader requests about councillor roles in removing Niki Gladding from committee positions. The article:
- Lists how each councillor voted (two against, one absent, eight in favor)
- Characterizes the removal as punishment "for revealing the council's plan to discharge semi treated sewage into the Shotover River after denying for over six months that a problem existed"
- States the sewage discharge started "the next day" after the vote
- Raises questions about water sample authenticity, claiming scientific evidence was "lost or did not exist"
- Embeds previously unpublished video of the vote and mayor's remarks
- Links to previous Crux coverage including interviews with Gladding and Mayor Lewers
- Removes paywall on September 8 (article publication date)

The article presents these events with strong editorial framing that portrays the councillor vote as improper retaliation against a whistleblower, rather than as a legitimate governance decision.

---

## Context Considerations
Per ReviewContext.MD, Queenstown Lakes local government elections are underway. The article is published on September 8, 2025, during the election period when multiple councillors named in the article are seeking re-election, including:
- Niki Gladding (seeking third term, running for Wanaka-Upper Clutha Ward)
- Glyn Lewers (Mayor, standing for re-election)
- Various councillors named as voting for or against Gladding's removal

This electoral context is critical. The article's characterization of the vote affects how voters evaluate these candidates, yet the article provides no balance, no explanation of the councillors' reasoning for their votes, and no right of reply to those implicitly criticized.

Per the NZMC Complaints README, Crux has a history of upheld complaints (60% upheld rate in 2020-2022) with consistent patterns of:
- Failure to distinguish comment from fact
- Inadequate right of reply
- Lack of balance
- Inaccurate headlines
- Media Council noting "serious breakdown in professional relationship" with QLDC entities

This article exhibits similar patterns to previously upheld complaints.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**

The article contains multiple factual inaccuracies and misleading characterizations:

1. **Characterization of Gladding's Removal:**
The article states Gladding was removed "for revealing the council's plan to discharge semi treated sewage into the Shotover River after denying for over six months that a problem existed." (lines 8-9)

This is a highly partisan characterization presented as fact. The article does not:
- Quote the actual resolution or reasons for removal from council records
- Explain what "committee roles" she was removed from
- Provide the council's stated reasoning for the decision
- Note whether the removal was for breach of confidentiality, governance protocols, or other specific reasons
- Acknowledge any legitimate governance concerns that may have motivated the decision

The framing assumes as fact that the removal was retaliatory punishment for whistleblowing, rather than a legitimate governance decision. This is opinion presented as fact.

2. **"Semi treated sewage" Characterization:**
The article characterizes the discharge as "semi treated sewage into the Shotover River" (line 8). The article does not:
- Explain what level of treatment the wastewater received
- Provide technical details about treatment standards
- Note whether the discharge met regulatory requirements
- Include expert assessment of environmental impact
- Present the CE's explanation of emergency circumstances requiring the discharge

The term "semi treated sewage" is emotionally loaded and potentially inaccurate without technical definition.

3. **Timing of Discharge:**
"The sewage discharge into the Shotover River started the next day" (line 16)

This creates a misleading causal connection suggesting the vote enabled or caused the discharge, when:
- The CE's emergency powers likely existed independently of the committee vote
- The discharge timing may have been dictated by infrastructure needs, not the vote
- No evidence is provided that the vote affected the discharge timing

The juxtaposition implies causation without establishing it.

4. **Water Sample Claims:**
The article states: "with unanswered questions over the authenticity of the 'clean/treated' water sample - QLDC said the supporting scientific evidence was either 'lost or did not exist.'" (lines 16-17)

This serious allegation about evidence tampering or fraud is:
- Not attributed to a specific source or document
- Not explained with context about what sample, when, or what questions
- Not balanced with QLDC's full explanation
- Presented as established fact rather than disputed claim

The use of scare quotes around "clean/treated" implies the water wasn't actually clean, which is opinion not fact.

5. **"Denying for over six months that a problem existed" (line 9):**
This claim is not substantiated with:
- Specific dates of the six-month period
- Quotes from council statements denying the problem
- Evidence of when the problem first arose
- Explanation of what was denied and when

**Fairness Issues:**

The article is fundamentally unfair to those who voted for Gladding's removal:

1. **No Right of Reply:**
The eight councillors who voted for removal (Barry Bruce, Gavin Bartlett, Glyn Lewers, Craig Ferguson, Lyal Cocks, Melissa White, Matt Wong, Cody Tucker) are named but given no opportunity to:
- Explain their reasoning for the vote
- Respond to the implication they acted improperly
- Provide context about governance concerns
- Address the suggestion they enabled environmental damage

2. **No Context for Decision:**
The article provides no information about:
- What allegations or concerns led to the removal motion
- Whether Gladding breached confidentiality requirements
- What governance protocols may have been violated
- The council's deliberative process
- Arguments made for and against removal
- Whether there was a staff report recommending removal

3. **Biased Framing:**
The article's framing throughout assumes Gladding was wrongly removed for proper whistleblowing, rather than presenting this as one perspective. The councillors who voted for removal are implicitly cast as:
- Suppressing whistleblowers
- Enabling environmental damage
- Acting improperly or unethically

This character assassination occurs without fair opportunity for response.

4. **Selective Information:**
The article links to Mayor Lewers' interview but characterizes it as merely "coverage of the day" rather than presenting his perspective in the article itself. Readers must actively seek out the mayor's view rather than having balance within the article.

5. **No Expert Assessment:**
The article provides no independent assessment of:
- Whether the sewage discharge was necessary or properly managed
- Whether Gladding's removal was procedurally proper
- Whether the water quality claims are accurate
- What regulatory oversight occurred

**Balance Issues:**

The article is entirely one-sided:

1. **No Alternative Narrative:**
The article presents only the narrative that:
- Gladding heroically revealed wrongdoing
- Council denied the problem for six months
- Gladding was improperly removed in retaliation
- Sewage was discharged improperly
- Evidence was lost or fabricated

No alternative explanations are presented, such as:
- Emergency infrastructure circumstances may have required discharge
- Gladding may have violated legitimate confidentiality protocols
- The removal may have been for governance reasons unrelated to the disclosure
- Water quality monitoring may have shown safe discharge
- The CE may have properly used lawful emergency powers

2. **Electoral Imbalance:**
During an election period, this article provides substantial benefit to:
- Niki Gladding (portrayed as principled whistleblower persecuted for telling truth)
- Quentin Smith and Esther Whitehead (shown as voting against removal, implicitly endorsing them)

While providing substantial harm to:
- Glyn Lewers (mayor who presided over vote, implicitly criticized)
- The eight councillors who voted for removal (implicitly characterized as improper)

This creates unfair electoral advantage without balance or right of reply.

3. **No Regulatory Perspective:**
The article does not include comment from:
- Environmental regulators (ORC) about discharge compliance
- Health officials about water safety
- Independent wastewater experts
- Ombudsman or other oversight bodies

**Evidence:**

"Crux readers have been asking in considerable numbers for exactly the role played by existing councillors and mayor Glyn Lewers in the removal of Niki Gladding from her QLDC committee roles for revealing the council's plan to discharge semi treated sewage into the Shotover River after denying for over six months that a problem existed." (lines 7-9)

This opening sentence presents as fact a highly contested characterization of events. The phrase "for revealing the council's plan" assumes causation and motive without evidence.

"The sewage discharge into the Shotover River started the next day - with unanswered questions over the authenticity of the 'clean/treated' water sample - QLDC said the supporting scientific evidence was either 'lost or did not exist.'" (lines 16-17)

This juxtaposition creates misleading implications about timing, causation, and evidence tampering without providing balanced context.

The article names eight councillors who voted for removal but provides zero context for their decision, zero quotes from them explaining their reasoning, and zero balance to the implicit criticism.

**Findings:**

This article constitutes a clear breach of Principle 1. It fails to provide accuracy (making unsubstantiated claims about evidence and motives), fails fairness (giving no right of reply to eight named councillors implicitly criticized), and fails balance (presenting only one narrative during an election period). The article purports to answer factual questions ("exactly who did what") but delivers partisan characterization of events without balance. The electoral timing makes this breach particularly serious, as it provides unfair advantage to some candidates while denying fairness to others.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The article systematically fails to distinguish between factual information and editorial opinion/characterization:

**Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**

1. **Factual Content:**
The article contains limited actual facts:
- Vote count: Two against (Smith, Whitehead), eight for, one absent (Guy) - This appears factual
- Video of the vote exists - Factual claim
- Links to previous coverage - Factual

2. **Opinion Presented as Fact:**
The vast majority of substantive content is opinion/characterization presented as fact:

- "Removal...for revealing the council's plan to discharge semi treated sewage" (lines 8-9) - This is editorial characterization of motive, not established fact
- "After denying for over six months that a problem existed" (line 9) - Characterization without evidence
- "Semi treated sewage" (line 8) - Pejorative characterization, not technical description
- "The sewage discharge...started the next day" (line 16) - Implies causation that's not established
- "Unanswered questions over the authenticity of the 'clean/treated' water sample" (lines 16-17) - Characterization suggesting fraud without evidence
- "QLDC said the supporting scientific evidence was either 'lost or did not exist'" (line 17) - Presented as admission of wrongdoing without context

**Lack of Clear Identification:**

The article is presented as news reporting ("by Peter Newport") answering factual questions from readers. It is not labeled as:
- Opinion piece
- Commentary
- Editorial
- Analysis

The structure suggests objective factual reporting: "Crux readers have been asking...The short answer is..." This framing promises facts but delivers opinion.

**Factual Foundation Issues:**

Even the factual claims lack proper foundation:

1. **Vote Details:**
While the vote count is provided, there's no citation to:
- Official council minutes
- Meeting date
- Resolution number
- Exact wording of the motion

2. **"Lost or did not exist" Evidence:**
This explosive claim is not attributed to:
- Specific QLDC document
- Specific official statement
- Date of statement
- Context of what evidence and why

3. **Six Months of Denial:**
No specific evidence provided of:
- What was denied
- When denial statements were made
- Who made them
- When the problem actually began

**Evidence:**

The article's opening frames itself as providing facts: "Crux readers have been asking in considerable numbers for exactly the role played by existing councillors..." (line 7)

The language promises factual information ("exactly the role") but immediately delivers opinion: "removal of Niki Gladding from her QLDC committee roles for revealing..." (lines 7-9)

The causal word "for" (line 8) is editorial judgment, not fact. The removal could have been "following her disclosure" or "after she disclosed" - neutral factual phrasing. "For revealing" asserts the disclosure was the cause and implies improper retaliation.

"The short answer is that only two councillors voted against the removal of Councillor Gladding" (line 10)

The word "only" is editorial - it implies the number is surprisingly small and suggests moral judgment about those who voted for removal.

"The sewage discharge into the Shotover River started the next day" (line 16)

This factual statement is immediately followed by editorial content: "with unanswered questions over the authenticity..." This mixes fact (timing) with opinion (implications of fraud) without clear distinction.

**Findings:**

The article breaches Principle 4 by presenting editorial opinion and characterization as factual reporting. While it contains some factual elements (vote count, video availability), the substantive content consists of contested characterizations presented as established facts. The article should have been clearly labeled as opinion/commentary, or should have maintained clear distinction between factual vote information and editorial characterization of the removal's propriety. As published, it misleads readers into believing they are reading factual reporting when they are reading partisan editorial content.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "Exactly who did what - and how they voted - on the Niki Gladding dismissal"

**Accuracy Assessment:**

Unlike many headlines that present opinion as fact, this headline is largely accurate:
- The article does state who voted and how they voted
- It uses the term "dismissal" which, while stronger than "removal," is not unreasonable characterization
- The headline promises information about voting, which the article provides

**Substance Reflection:**

The headline accurately reflects key article content:
- Names of councillors and their votes are provided
- Information about "who did what" is included (though heavily editorialized)
- The vote on Gladding's removal is the subject matter

**Potential Issues:**

While not inaccurate, the headline does not signal:
- The article's editorial/opinion nature
- The contested characterization of events
- The lack of balance or right of reply

However, these are weaknesses in article labeling (Principle 4) rather than headline inaccuracy per se.

**Findings:**

The headline does not breach Principle 6. While the article itself has serious problems, the headline reasonably reflects the article content and does not make false or misleading claims. It accurately signals the article will identify councillors and their votes on Gladding's removal.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**

The article is not clearly identified as opinion content. It carries a byline ("by Peter Newport - Sep 08, 2025") suggesting news reporting, and uses a news article format. There is no label such as "Opinion," "Commentary," "Analysis," or "Editorial" that would signal to readers this is not straight factual reporting.

The article's framing promises factual information: "Crux readers have been asking...for exactly the role played" - this signals factual reporting, not opinion.

**Foundation of Fact:**

Even if treated as opinion content, the article has serious weaknesses in factual foundation:

- Vote count appears factual, though not cited to official records
- Claims about "six months of denial" are not substantiated with dates or quotes
- Allegations about "lost or did not exist" evidence are not attributed to specific sources
- Characterizations of motives ("for revealing") are opinion not supported by documented facts
- Timing claims ("started the next day") lack context about whether causation exists

Per Principle 5: "Material facts on which an opinion is based should be accurate." The factual foundation here is inadequate for the opinions expressed.

**Balance Requirement:**

Principle 5 notes "with comment and opinion balance is not essential." However, this protection applies to "opinion, whether newspaper column or internet blog" that is "clearly identified as such."

Because this article is not clearly identified as opinion, it cannot claim exemption from balance requirements. It presents as news reporting and should therefore meet news standards for balance.

**Evidence:**

The article structure and framing suggest news reporting:
- "Crux readers have been asking..." - responding to news demand
- "The short answer is..." - providing factual information
- "Here's Crux full, unedited video..." - presenting documentary evidence
- Standard byline format with no opinion/commentary label

Per Crux's past complaints (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940), the Media Council has repeatedly found that Crux mixes opinion with news without clear labeling, and has warned: "strongly suggests Crux take greater care in the future" and noted "opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news."

This article follows the same pattern that led to upheld complaints in Cases 2891 and 2940.

**Findings:**

If this article were clearly labeled as opinion or commentary, some of the balance concerns might be mitigated. However, because it presents in news format without clear identification as opinion content, it cannot claim the protection of Principle 5. This constitutes a potential breach - the article should have been clearly labeled to help readers understand they are reading editorial opinion about the vote, not balanced factual reporting about who voted and why.

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Electoral Context:**

This article is published on September 8, 2025, during an election period when multiple named councillors are seeking re-election. The article provides:

**Electoral Benefit to:**
- Niki Gladding - portrayed as principled whistleblower who was improperly removed, generating voter sympathy
- Quentin Smith and Esther Whitehead - identified as the only two who voted against removal, implicitly endorsing their judgment
- Those opposing Mayor Lewers - article casts doubt on his leadership during the vote

**Electoral Harm to:**
- Glyn Lewers (Mayor) - presided over vote that article frames as improper
- Barry Bruce, Gavin Bartlett, Craig Ferguson, Lyal Cocks, Melissa White, Matt Wong, Cody Tucker - all named as voting for removal without opportunity to explain reasoning
- These councillors are implicitly characterized as:
  - Suppressing whistleblowers
  - Enabling environmental damage
  - Acting on improper motives

**Disclosure Requirements:**

The article should disclose:
- That this is published during an election period
- That multiple named councillors are seeking re-election
- That the characterization of this vote affects their electoral prospects
- The electoral context that affects how readers should interpret the content

The article makes no mention of the electoral context. Unlike the Gladding profile article (250903) which at least mentioned she was "seeking a third term," this article provides no electoral context disclosure at all.

**Timing and Impact:**

Publishing this article during an election period has direct electoral impact:
- Voters evaluating Mayor Lewers receive negative impression
- Voters evaluating the eight councillors who voted for removal receive negative impression
- Voters evaluating Smith and Whitehead receive positive impression
- Voters evaluating Gladding receive positive impression
- No balancing information is provided about the reasoning for the vote

**Author-Subject Relationship:**

The article is by Peter Newport, who has extensively covered Niki Gladding favorably in previous articles (250903 profile). No disclosure is made of:
- Whether Newport has developed advocacy relationship with Gladding
- Whether this coverage is coordinated with Gladding's campaign
- Whether other candidates were offered similar favorable coverage
- Editorial policies about election coverage balance

**Pattern of Coverage:**

This article appears part of a pattern of Crux coverage favorable to Niki Gladding during the election:
- September 3: Extensive favorable profile of Gladding
- September 8: This article portraying her as wronged whistleblower
- Both articles provide electoral benefit without balancing coverage of other candidates

**Evidence:**

The article provides substantial electoral benefit by naming and implicitly criticizing eight councillors without right of reply during an election period.

The video release is described: "This video has not previously been published." (line 16) - Why is previously unpublished video being released now, during the election? This timing raises questions about electoral motivation.

The paywall removal: "(paywall removed September 8.)" (line 16) - Removing the paywall on election-related content that benefits certain candidates raises questions about in-kind campaign contribution.

Per NZMC Principle 10: "Where a story is enabled by sponsorship, gift or financial inducement, that sponsorship, gift or financial inducement should be declared."

If Gladding's campaign benefits from timing and framing of this article, that electoral benefit should be disclosed.

**Findings:**

The article constitutes a potential breach of Principle 10 by failing to disclose the electoral context and the substantial electoral impact of the article's one-sided characterization of the vote. Publishing during an election period without disclosure of electoral context, without balance, and without right of reply for named councillors being implicitly criticized, provides unfair electoral advantage. At minimum, the article should have disclosed the electoral timing and provided right of reply to those named and implicitly criticized.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The article does not raise privacy concerns. All individuals named (councillors, mayor) are public officials engaged in public votes on matters of public record. The vote on Gladding's removal from committee positions is clearly a matter of public interest and public record.

Naming councillors and how they voted on a public council matter is not an invasion of privacy.

**Findings:**

No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical/mental disability.

**Findings:**

No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article does not appear to rely on confidential sources requiring protection. The vote information should be public record.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information.

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

While the article references video content, the text provided does not include details about video editing or manipulation that would allow assessment under this principle.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The article presents contested characterizations as facts, provides no right of reply to eight named councillors implicitly criticized, and lacks balance by presenting only one narrative of events. During an election period, this one-sided coverage provides unfair electoral advantage to some candidates while harming others named in the article. Serious inaccuracies include unsubstantiated claims about evidence being "lost or did not exist," misleading causation between vote and discharge timing, and characterization of motive ("for revealing") without factual foundation.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The article presents editorial opinion and characterization as factual reporting. While framed as answering factual questions ("exactly who did what"), the article delivers partisan characterization of events without clear distinction between fact and opinion. The article is not labeled as opinion content despite consisting primarily of editorial characterization rather than factual reporting.

3. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion content despite functioning as such. It uses news format and framing ("readers have been asking for facts") without clear labeling that would help readers understand they are reading editorial opinion, not balanced factual reporting.

4. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article fails to disclose the electoral context and the substantial electoral impact of its one-sided characterization. Publishing during an election period without disclosing electoral timing, without balance, and without right of reply for named councillors creates unfair electoral advantage for some candidates and disadvantage for others.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This article exhibits patterns consistent with Crux's history of upheld NZMC complaints:

1. **Failure to Distinguish Comment from Fact** (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940):
Like previous upheld complaints, this article presents "opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news." The characterization of the vote as retaliation "for revealing" wrongdoing is opinion presented as fact, exactly the pattern identified in Cases 2891 and 2940.

2. **Inadequate Right of Reply** (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356):
Like Case 3356 where Crux was found to make "paltry effort" to contact subject, this article makes zero effort to contact the eight councillors whose votes are characterized negatively. The Media Council's warning from Case 3356 is directly applicable: Crux must give subjects proper right of reply on key claims before publication.

3. **Lack of Balance** (Cases 2891, 2940):
Like previous upheld complaints, the article presents only information supporting a predetermined narrative (Gladding wrongly removed) without presenting balancing information about legitimate governance concerns that may have motivated the vote.

4. **Deteriorating Relationship with QLDC** (All previous cases):
This article continues the pattern the Media Council noted in Case 2940: "serious breakdown in professional relationship" and "festering mutual suspicion and growing antagonism" between Crux and QLDC entities.

5. **Electoral Advocacy**:
This article, combined with the September 3 Gladding profile, shows a pattern of advocacy journalism during an election period that benefits specific candidates (Gladding, Smith, Whitehead) while harming others (Lewers and eight councillors) without disclosure or balance.

---

**Electoral Context:**

This article's publication during an election period has several critical implications:

1. **Campaign Benefit:**
The article provides substantial benefit to Niki Gladding's campaign by:
- Portraying her as heroic whistleblower
- Characterizing her removal as improper retaliation
- Generating voter sympathy for perceived persecution
- Reinforcing narrative from September 3 profile article

2. **Unfair Electoral Disadvantage:**
The article harms electoral prospects of:
- Mayor Glyn Lewers (presided over allegedly improper vote)
- Eight named councillors (voted for allegedly improper removal without opportunity to explain)
- These candidates are denied fair opportunity to explain their reasoning or defend their actions

3. **Voter Deception:**
Voters reading this article may believe they are reading balanced factual reporting about who voted and why, when they are actually reading partisan editorial characterization of the vote as improper retaliation. This undermines informed democratic choice.

4. **Pattern of Biased Coverage:**
Combined with September 3 Gladding profile, this represents a pattern of:
- September 3: 1,800-word favorable profile of Gladding presenting her policy platform and criticizing opponents
- September 8: Article portraying Gladding as persecuted whistleblower and implicitly criticizing nine councillors/mayor
- No similar favorable coverage identified for other candidates
- No right of reply for those criticized

5. **Heightened Standards:**
Electoral journalism requires heightened attention to fairness and balance because of direct impact on democratic outcomes. The NZMC preamble states "An independent press plays a vital role in a democracy" - this article fails to fulfill that role by providing one-sided characterization during an election without balance or disclosure of electoral context.

6. **Timing Raises Questions:**
Why release "previously unpublished video" (line 16) during the election period rather than when the vote occurred? Why remove the paywall on September 8? These timing decisions suggest electoral rather than journalistic motivation and should be disclosed.

---

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are strong grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The article fails to provide accuracy, fairness, or balance. Specific grounds:
   - Makes unsubstantiated claim that scientific evidence was "lost or did not exist" without attribution or context
   - Characterizes removal motive ("for revealing") as fact without evidence
   - Creates misleading causation between vote and discharge timing
   - Provides no right of reply to eight named councillors implicitly criticized for their votes
   - No balancing perspective on legitimate governance concerns that may have motivated vote
   - No explanation from those who voted for removal about their reasoning
   - One-sided electoral coverage providing unfair advantage to some candidates while harming others

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The article fails to clearly distinguish between factual information and opinion. Specific grounds:
   - Presents contested characterizations ("for revealing," "semi treated sewage," "denying for over six months") as facts
   - Article framed as providing factual information ("exactly who did what") but delivers editorial opinion
   - Not labeled as opinion or commentary despite consisting primarily of editorial characterization
   - Mixes factual elements (vote count) with opinion (characterization of propriety) without clear distinction

3. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: The article fails to disclose electoral context and impact. Specific grounds:
   - Published during election period without disclosing electoral context
   - Provides substantial electoral benefit to some candidates (Gladding, Smith, Whitehead)
   - Provides substantial electoral harm to others (Lewers, eight named councillors)
   - Timing of video release and paywall removal during election raises questions about electoral motivation
   - No disclosure of electoral context or impact
   - Pattern with September 3 article shows consistent advocacy for Gladding during election

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 5 - Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion content despite functioning as such, violating reader expectations of factual reporting.

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Inaccuracy - Unsubstantiated Claims:**
   - "QLDC said the supporting scientific evidence was either 'lost or did not exist.'" (line 17) - Serious allegation without attribution to specific source, document, or date
   - "After denying for over six months that a problem existed" (line 9) - No evidence provided of what was denied, when, or by whom
   - "For revealing the council's plan" (line 8) - Characterization of motive as fact without evidence

2. **Opinion Presented as Fact:**
   - "Removal of Niki Gladding from her QLDC committee roles for revealing the council's plan to discharge semi treated sewage into the Shotover River" (lines 8-9) - Editorial characterization presented as factual summary
   - "The sewage discharge into the Shotover River started the next day" (line 16) - Juxtaposition implies causation without establishing it
   - "Semi treated sewage" (line 8) - Pejorative characterization without technical definition

3. **Lack of Balance - No Right of Reply:**
   - Eight councillors named as voting for removal (line 14) with zero opportunity to explain their reasoning
   - No quotes from any councillor explaining the governance concerns
   - No context about what committee roles or why removal was proposed
   - No balancing perspective on whether removal was procedurally proper

4. **Electoral Impact Without Disclosure:**
   - Published September 8, 2025 during election period with no electoral context disclosure
   - Provides electoral benefit to Gladding (persecuted whistleblower narrative)
   - Provides electoral harm to eight named councillors and mayor (implicit criticism)
   - Pattern with September 3 favorable Gladding profile shows advocacy journalism without disclosure
   - Video described as "not previously been published" (line 16) - why release during election?
   - Paywall removed September 8 - providing free access to electoral content benefiting certain candidates

5. **No Clear Opinion Labeling:**
   - Framed as factual reporting: "Crux readers have been asking...for exactly the role played" (line 7)
   - Promise of facts: "The short answer is..." (line 10)
   - No label identifying content as "Opinion," "Commentary," or "Editorial"
   - Pattern continues from Cases 2891, 2940 where Media Council found "opinion liberally sprinkled through story presented as news"

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of the decision with fair prominence in the section where original article ran

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for:
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers
   - Barry Bruce, Gavin Bartlett, Craig Ferguson, Lyal Cocks, Melissa White, Matt Wong, Cody Tucker (councillors named as voting for removal)

   To be given fair prominence similar to original article, allowing them to explain their reasoning for voting for removal

4. **Correction/Retraction**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Article failed to provide balance or right of reply to named councillors
   - Characterization of removal motive ("for revealing") is disputed opinion, not established fact
   - Claims about "lost or did not exist" evidence require proper attribution and context
   - Article should have been labeled as opinion/commentary
   - Electoral context should have been disclosed

5. **Factual Corrections Required**:
   - Remove or properly attribute claim about "lost or did not exist" evidence
   - Remove characterization of motive ("for revealing") or clearly label as opinion
   - Add context about actual reasons stated for removal in council resolution
   - Clarify whether discharge timing was causally connected to vote or coincidental

6. **Process Improvements**: Request Crux establish clear editorial policies for:
   - Electoral coverage requiring balance and disclosure
   - Clear labeling of opinion vs. news content
   - Mandatory right of reply when individuals are named and implicitly criticized
   - Factual substantiation requirements for serious allegations
   - Disclosure of timing and editorial decisions that affect electoral outcomes

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Timing is Critical**: The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher is October 8, 2025 (one month from September 8 publication).

2. **Public Interest**: This complaint serves public interest by:
   - Protecting electoral integrity and fair campaign coverage
   - Ensuring voters receive balanced information for democratic choice
   - Preventing one-sided characterization from unfairly affecting election outcomes
   - Protecting reputations of named councillors denied right of reply
   - Holding media accountable for accuracy in serious allegations about "lost" evidence

3. **Standing**: Consider who should bring complaint:
   - Any of the eight named councillors (Barry Bruce, Gavin Bartlett, Craig Ferguson, Lyal Cocks, Melissa White, Matt Wong, Cody Tucker)
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers
   - QLDC (institutional complainant about inaccuracies)
   - Community member concerned about electoral fairness
   - NZMC will consider third-party complaints but may require consent from affected individuals

4. **Pattern Evidence**: This complaint is strengthened by:
   - Crux's 60% upheld complaint rate (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356)
   - Consistent pattern of mixing opinion with news without clear labeling
   - Media Council's previous warnings to "take greater care" (Case 2895)
   - Media Council's finding of "serious breakdown in professional relationship" (Case 2940)
   - This article exhibits identical patterns to upheld complaints

5. **Electoral Impact**: Document potential electoral impact:
   - Which named councillors are seeking re-election
   - Reach of Crux publication in QLDC area
   - Timing early in campaign period maximizes impact
   - Combined effect with September 3 Gladding profile
   - Whether article has influenced public discourse or voter perceptions

6. **Crux's Likely Defense**: Based on previous complaints, Crux will likely argue:
   - "Advocacy journalism" defending community interests
   - Public interest in holding council accountable
   - "Consistently opinionated" tone is their known style

   **Counter-arguments:**
   - Media Council has already ruled (Cases 2891, 2940) that advocacy journalism doesn't excuse accuracy, fairness, or fact/opinion distinction breaches
   - "Even if other matters it is pursuing are verifiable and important that does not detract from its obligations" (Case 3356)
   - Electoral period requires heightened standards for balance
   - Named individuals have right to reply regardless of publication's advocacy role

7. **Most Serious Breach**: The claim that "QLDC said the supporting scientific evidence was either 'lost or did not exist'" is potentially the most serious breach:
   - If true, it's explosive allegation requiring full substantiation
   - If mischaracterized, it's serious defamation of council
   - Either way, requires attribution, context, and right of reply
   - Focus complaint heavily on this unsubstantiated claim

**Conclusion:**

This article represents a significant failure of journalistic standards, particularly egregious in the electoral context. The combination of:
- Unsubstantiated serious allegations ("lost or did not exist" evidence)
- Opinion presented as fact (removal "for revealing" wrongdoing)
- Failure to distinguish fact from opinion
- Denial of right of reply to eight named councillors
- Lack of balance or alternative perspectives
- Failure to disclose electoral context and impact
- Pattern consistent with previous upheld complaints

...constitutes multiple breaches of NZMC principles.

The article's primary function appears to be electoral advocacy - supporting Niki Gladding's campaign narrative that she was improperly persecuted for whistleblowing, while harming the electoral prospects of nine other named officials without fair opportunity for response. This undermines electoral integrity and denies voters the balanced information necessary for informed democratic choice.

The most serious breach is the unsubstantiated claim about scientific evidence being "lost or did not exist" - a potentially explosive allegation that requires full attribution, context, and right of reply, none of which were provided.

A formal complaint is warranted and should be pursued before the October 8, 2025 deadline. The complaint serves not only to address this specific article but to hold Crux accountable for patterns identified in previous upheld complaints (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356) and to protect electoral integrity during a critical democratic process.

This article should be combined with the September 3 Gladding profile article in a single complaint demonstrating a pattern of biased electoral coverage favoring one candidate without balance or disclosure.
