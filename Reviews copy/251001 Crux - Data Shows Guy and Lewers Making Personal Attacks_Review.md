# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Data shows it's Guy and Lewers making the personal attacks - not their opponents
**Publication:** Crux
**Date:** October 1, 2025
**Author:** Queenstown Lakes Community Action
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

## Executive Summary
This article, authored by Queenstown Lakes Community Action and republished by Crux, presents a quantitative analysis of public statements made by Mayor Glyn Lewers, Councillor Lisa Guy, Councillor Niki Gladding, and mayoral candidate John Glover regarding the CEO recruitment process. The article categorizes comments as either "scrutiny" (focused on governance/process) or "personal" (focused on motives/character) and concludes that Lewers and Guy made significantly more personal attacks than Gladding and Glover. While the article addresses a matter of public interest during an election period and attempts a systematic analysis, it breaches NZMC principles through lack of balance (no right of reply from Guy or Lewers), confusion between fact and interpretation in the methodology and conclusions, editorial bias in Crux's framing, and potentially misleading headline that presents conclusions as established data when the categorization involves subjective interpretation.

## Article Summary
The article analyzes public comments made by four political figures during the week preceding October 1, 2025, concerning the CEO recruitment process at QLDC. The article categorizes each comment as either "scrutiny" (focused on governance, process, evidence) or "personal" (aimed at motives, intent, character).

Key claims include:
- Mayor Glyn Lewers made predominantly personal attacks against Gladding and Glover, describing Gladding's statements as "misleading," "irresponsible," "designed to disrupt," and accusing her of "undermining public confidence for her own gain"
- Councillor Lisa Guy similarly made mostly personal critiques, dismissing criticisms as "political theatrics" and speaking of "councillors who thrive on conflict"
- Councillor Niki Gladding focused primarily on process concerns but included some personal criticism calling Lewers' approach a "dangerous choice for Mayor"
- John Glover focused mostly on governance while occasionally straying into personal comments about "secret deals"
- The article presents a graph showing the balance between scrutiny and personal attacks for each person
- Questions sent to Guy, Lewers, and Cocks on September 29 and September 24 remain unanswered
- The article concludes "words matter" and personal attacks erode democratic trust

Crux includes an "Editor's Note" stating both Lewers and Guy are "unusually evasive" and "very comfortable accusing us and their opponents of 'misinformation' and even 'defamation.'" The note calls this "Dirty Politics and needs to be called out, using data rather than emotion."

---

## Context Considerations
ReviewContext.MD indicates that Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections are underway, Crux is a local news site reporting on QLDC matters, and Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council.

The electoral context is critical: this article is published during the 2025 local body elections when both Mayor Lewers (presumably seeking re-election) and John Glover (mayoral candidate challenging Lewers) are on the ballot. The article's conclusion that Lewers and Guy made significantly more "personal attacks" than their opponents could substantially influence voter perceptions just days before voting closes.

Additionally, the article reports that Councillor Guy previously attacked Crux threatening "all sorts of dire legal consequences" and that Mayor Lewers "has given his support to Lisa Guy's online complaints about Crux reporting" (line 83 from prior article reference). This creates an adversarial relationship between Crux and the article's subjects.

The substantive issue - the tone and nature of political discourse during elections - is clearly a matter of public interest. However, the method of categorizing "personal" vs. "scrutiny" comments involves subjective interpretation that requires transparency and fairness.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**

The article presents its methodology and conclusions with scientific certainty ("data shows," "analysis," "coded every comment") that obscures significant subjective interpretation in the categorization process:

- The central claim in the headline that "data shows it's Guy and Lewers making the personal attacks" (line 1) presents the conclusions as objective fact when the categorization of comments as "personal" vs. "scrutiny" necessarily involves interpretive judgment about intent and meaning.

- The article states "We categorised each comment as either: Scrutiny – focused on governance, process, or evidence. Personal – aimed at motives, intent, or character" (lines 38-41). However, many political statements inherently contain elements of both, and the decision to code them "conservatively" (line 43) still requires subjective judgment.

- Example: The article codes Gladding's statement that Lewers is a "dangerous choice for Mayor" as personal (line 66). However, this could also be coded as scrutiny if interpreted as a governance assessment based on the "blatant disregard for democratic process" she identified. The coding choice reflects interpretation.

- Example: The article codes Lewers' statement that information shared was "inaccurate and misleading" as scrutiny (line 53), but this could be interpreted as a personal attack on Gladding's credibility and honesty. The differential coding reflects subjective judgment.

- The article claims to show "what the balance looks like" (line 73) and describes the pattern as "stark" (line 80), presenting graphical data as definitive proof. However, the underlying categorization methodology is not sufficiently transparent or validated.

- The article does not disclose who conducted the analysis, what their qualifications are, whether multiple coders independently verified the categorization, or what inter-rater reliability measures were used - standard practices for credible content analysis.

However, the article does provide direct quotations from the four subjects (lines 49-72) allowing readers some ability to assess the characterizations, and it offers to update the analysis if candidates identify missed or miscoded comments (lines 86-88).

**Fairness Issues:**

The article is fundamentally unfair to Mayor Glyn Lewers and Councillor Lisa Guy:

- Neither Lewers nor Guy were given opportunity to respond to the analysis before publication. The article states questions were sent to them on September 29 and September 24, but there is no indication they were given advance notice of this specific "data analysis" or its conclusions about them making "personal attacks."

- The questions referenced (lines 103-112) concern the CEO recruitment process, not the tone analysis. There is no evidence that Lewers or Guy were asked to comment on the categorization methodology or findings before publication.

- The article characterizes Guy's excuse for missing a deadline as celebrating "her husband's birthday" (line 12, with scare quotes implied by context), which could be read as dismissive or mocking of a legitimate personal commitment.

- Crux's Editor's Note (lines 10-16) is highly editorialized and prejudicial, stating Lewers and Guy are "unusually evasive," "very comfortable" making accusations, and engage in "Dirty Politics." This framing primes readers to view the analysis as confirming pre-existing editorial judgment rather than neutral investigation.

- The article is also potentially unfair to Gladding and Glover by holding them to different standards. Their occasional "personal" comments are described as having "strayed into the personal at times" (line 72) with softer language than used for Lewers and Guy.

**Balance Issues:**

The article lacks balance in several respects:

- No right of reply from Lewers or Guy about the methodology or conclusions
- No independent expert validation of the content analysis methodology (e.g., political scientist, communication researcher)
- No acknowledgment that categorizing political speech as "personal" vs. "scrutiny" involves interpretation, not objective measurement
- No discussion of whether defensive responses to accusations might reasonably include characterization of those accusations (e.g., if someone alleges misconduct, is calling the allegation "misleading" a personal attack or legitimate defense?)
- No context about whether the comments occurred in sequence (defensive responses to prior accusations) or were unprovoked
- No presentation of the actual data/graph referenced (line 77) in the text provided, making independent verification impossible
- No disclosure of Queenstown Lakes Community Action's potential political orientation, funding sources, or relationship with any of the candidates

The article does make some efforts at balance by:
- Providing direct quotations from all four subjects (lines 49-72)
- Inviting candidates to identify missed or miscoded comments (lines 86-88)
- Acknowledging that Gladding and Glover also made some personal comments (lines 65-66, 71-72)
- Explaining the methodology "can be found in the comments document" (line 45)

However, these efforts do not provide adequate balance for an analysis that could significantly affect an election by labeling two candidates as engaging in "personal attacks" and "Dirty Politics."

**Evidence:**

"Data shows it's Guy and Lewers making the personal attacks - not their opponents" (headline) - Presents interpretive categorization as objective data.

"This is Dirty Politics and needs to be called out, using data rather than emotion." (line 14) - Editor's Note characterizes subjects before analysis is presented, showing editorial bias.

"We categorised each comment as either: Scrutiny... or Personal" (lines 38-41) - Binary categorization of inherently complex political speech.

"Where comments contained elements of both, we coded them conservatively." (line 43) - Acknowledges ambiguity but does not explain "conservative" coding rules or who applied them.

"The pattern is stark. Lewers and Guy leaned heavily on personal critiques." (lines 80-81) - Presents conclusions as definitive when based on interpretive coding.

No evidence provided that Lewers or Guy were given opportunity to respond to the analysis methodology or findings before publication.

**Findings:**

The article breaches Principle 1 through lack of fairness, questionable accuracy claims, and insufficient balance. While the underlying topic - the nature of political discourse during elections - is clearly of public interest, the article presents interpretive analysis as objective "data" without adequate transparency about methodology, validation, or coder qualifications. Most critically, the subjects of serious criticism (being labeled as making "personal attacks" and engaging in "Dirty Politics" during an election) were not given fair opportunity to respond to the analysis. The highly editorialized Crux Editor's Note further undermines fairness by prejudicing readers against Lewers and Guy before the analysis is presented.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The article systematically fails to distinguish between factual information (direct quotations from the subjects) and interpretative conclusions (categorization of those quotations as "personal" or "scrutiny") in several key areas:

**Fact vs. Interpretation Confusion:**

- The headline "Data shows it's Guy and Lewers making the personal attacks" (line 1) presents what is fundamentally an interpretive analysis as factual data. "Data" implies objective measurement, but categorizing speech as "personal attacks" requires subjective judgment about intent and meaning.

- The Editor's Note states "This is Dirty Politics and needs to be called out, using data rather than emotion" (line 14). The phrase "using data rather than emotion" positions the analysis as objective science rather than interpretive categorization. "Dirty Politics" is a loaded political term (referencing Nicky Hager's book about underhanded political tactics) that frames the subjects as engaging in unethical behavior.

- The article states "The pattern is stark. Lewers and Guy leaned heavily on personal critiques. Gladding and Glover leaned more on process" (lines 80-81). This presents the categorization results as factual findings rather than interpretive conclusions.

- The article describes comments being "coded" (lines 43, 76) using social science terminology that implies systematic, validated methodology. However, no evidence is provided of methodological rigor (inter-rater reliability, coding manual, validated categories, etc.).

**Clear Factual Reporting:**

The article does provide clear factual reporting in places:
- Direct quotations from all four subjects (lines 49-72) with specific examples of their statements
- Factual information about when questions were sent (lines 111-112)
- Acknowledgment that the analysis is available for review and challenge (lines 86-88)
- Sources listed at the end (lines 121-129)

**Methodology Transparency Issues:**

The article claims "An explanation of how we carried out the analysis can be found in the comments document which we link to below" (line 45). However, the text provided does not include this document, making it impossible to assess the actual methodology or verify the categorizations.

Key methodological questions left unanswered:
- Who conducted the analysis? (Queenstown Lakes Community Action, but who specifically?)
- What are their qualifications for content analysis?
- How many coders were used?
- What specific criteria distinguished "personal" from "scrutiny"?
- How were ambiguous cases resolved?
- What inter-rater reliability was achieved?
- Were any systematic biases controlled for?

Without this transparency, readers cannot distinguish between rigorous analysis and selective interpretation.

**Opinion as Fact:**

The Crux Editor's Note (lines 10-16) is pure editorial opinion but is presented as introduction to factual analysis:
- "Both Mayor Lewers and Councillor Lisa Guy unusually evasive" - opinion
- "Very comfortable accusing us and their opponents of 'misinformation' and even 'defamation'" - characterization
- "This is Dirty Politics" - political judgment
- "Her excuse? 'I was celebrating my husband's birthday.'" - dismissive framing

This opinion primes readers to interpret the subsequent "analysis" as confirming these editorial views rather than as independent investigation.

**Evidence:**

Headline: "Data shows it's Guy and Lewers making the personal attacks" (line 1) - Interpretive categorization presented as objective data.

"This is Dirty Politics and needs to be called out, using data rather than emotion." (line 14) - Political judgment framed as data-driven conclusion.

"The pattern is stark." (line 80) - Definitive conclusion about interpretive categorization.

"We categorised each comment as either: Scrutiny... or Personal" (lines 38-41) - Binary coding of complex political speech presented without acknowledgment of interpretive judgment involved.

Editor's Note characterizations presented as fact rather than editorial opinion.

**Findings:**

The article breaches Principle 4 by failing to maintain clear distinction between factual information (what was said) and interpretive conclusions (whether statements constitute "personal attacks" vs. "scrutiny"). The use of "data" terminology and scientific framing obscures the inherently subjective nature of categorizing political speech. The Crux Editor's Note compounds this breach by presenting editorial opinions as if they are factual foundations for the analysis. The article should have clearly identified the categorization process as interpretive analysis requiring judgment, disclosed the methodology fully, and separated editorial opinion from the analysis itself.

---

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "Data shows it's Guy and Lewers making the personal attacks - not their opponents"

**Accuracy Assessment:**

The headline presents as objective fact ("data shows") what is actually an interpretive analysis. While the article does present categorized comments and analysis, the categorization of political speech as "personal attacks" versus "scrutiny" necessarily involves subjective interpretation, not pure data measurement.

The phrase "personal attacks" in the headline is stronger and more accusatory than the article's actual methodology, which categorizes comments as "Personal – aimed at motives, intent, or character" (line 42). "Personal attacks" carries connotations of aggression and impropriety that go beyond "personal" as a neutral category.

The headline's definitive tone "it's Guy and Lewers making the personal attacks - not their opponents" presents a binary conclusion when the article acknowledges that Gladding and Glover also made personal comments: "Gladding's focus was much more on process. But her language wasn't without some personal edge" (lines 62-65) and "Glover also kept most of his focus on governance. But he, too, strayed into the personal at times" (lines 68-72).

**Misleading Elements:**

The headline could mislead readers by:

1. **Suggesting objective measurement**: "Data shows" implies scientific measurement when the analysis requires interpretive judgment
2. **Overstating conclusions**: "Personal attacks" is stronger than the article's "personal" category and carries negative connotations
3. **Oversimplifying findings**: The headline suggests Guy/Lewers make personal attacks while Gladding/Glover do not, when the article acknowledges all four made some personal comments, just in different proportions
4. **Obscuring methodology**: No indication in headline that conclusions depend on subjective categorization

**More Accurate Headlines Would Be:**

- "Analysis suggests Guy and Lewers used more personal language than opponents in CEO debate"
- "Community group codes political comments, finds different approaches by candidates"
- "Study categorizes Lewers and Guy statements as more personal than process-focused"

**Substance Reflection:**

The headline does accurately reflect the article's key conclusion that Lewers and Guy were coded as making more "personal" comments than Gladding and Glover. However, it does so in language that overstates the objectivity and certainty of those findings.

**Evidence:**

Headline: "Data shows it's Guy and Lewers making the personal attacks - not their opponents" (line 1)

Compare to methodology: "We categorised each comment as either: Scrutiny – focused on governance, process, or evidence. Personal – aimed at motives, intent, or character." (lines 38-42) - Uses "personal" not "personal attacks"

Compare to acknowledgment of complexity: "Where comments contained elements of both, we coded them conservatively." (line 43) - Acknowledges subjective judgment required

Compare to findings: "Gladding's focus was much more on process. But her language wasn't without some personal edge." (lines 62-65) - Acknowledges Gladding also made personal comments

**Findings:**

The headline breaches Principle 6 by presenting as objective data ("data shows") what the article itself acknowledges requires interpretive judgment. The phrase "personal attacks" is stronger and more accusatory than warranted by the methodology, which simply categorizes comments as "personal" versus "scrutiny." The headline oversimplifies by suggesting a binary difference when the article acknowledges all four subjects made some personal comments in varying proportions. A more accurate headline would acknowledge the interpretive nature of the analysis and use neutral language consistent with the stated methodology.

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Queenstown Lakes Community Action Disclosure:**

The article is authored by "Queenstown Lakes Community Action" and republished by Crux with permission (line 16). However, the article provides no information about:
- What Queenstown Lakes Community Action is (advocacy group, political organization, community association?)
- Who its members or leadership are
- What its political orientation or objectives are
- Whether it has endorsed or opposed any candidates in the election
- How it is funded
- Whether its members have any relationships with the candidates being analyzed
- Why it chose to conduct this analysis at this particular time during the election

This lack of disclosure is problematic because readers cannot assess potential bias or conflicts of interest in an analysis that could significantly affect an election by characterizing some candidates as making "personal attacks" and engaging in "Dirty Politics."

**Crux's Pre-existing Adversarial Relationship:**

The article and Editor's Note make clear that Crux has an adversarial relationship with the subjects of criticism:

- "At Crux we have found both Mayor Lewers and Councillor Lisa Guy unusually evasive when it comes to answering actual questions" (lines 11-12)
- Lisa Guy "attacked Crux threatening all sorts of dire legal consequences" (line 12)
- Guy's excuse was "I was celebrating my husband's birthday" (line 12) - dismissive tone
- From previous article (referenced in line 103): Guy threatened Media Council complaint, Lewers "has given his support to Lisa Guy's online complaints about Crux reporting"

Crux republishes this analysis that concludes Guy and Lewers engage in "personal attacks" and "Dirty Politics" just days after they criticized or threatened Crux. This creates potential conflict of interest where Crux benefits from publishing analysis that damages its critics during an election.

The Editor's Note explicitly frames the article as settling scores: "This is Dirty Politics and needs to be called out, using data rather than emotion" (line 14). The language suggests Crux is using the "data analysis" to vindicate its position against Guy and Lewers.

**Electoral Timing:**

Publishing this analysis during the election period when:
- Mayor Lewers is presumably seeking re-election
- John Glover is challenging Lewers for mayor
- The article characterizes Lewers as making "personal attacks" while Glover focused on "governance"

This timing creates appearance that the analysis serves electoral purposes, either by the original authors (Queenstown Lakes Community Action) or by Crux in choosing to republish it.

**Inadequate Disclosure:**

While the article does disclose:
- That it is authored by Queenstown Lakes Community Action, not Crux staff (lines 5, 16)
- That Crux is republishing with permission (line 16)
- That Guy and Lewers have criticized Crux (lines 11-12, 103)

The article does not disclose:
- Who Queenstown Lakes Community Action is or what their interests are
- Whether the group has political orientation or candidate preferences
- How the analysis was funded
- Whether Crux solicited this analysis or it was offered
- Whether Crux contributed to or influenced the analysis methodology
- How the adversarial relationship between Crux and Guy/Lewers might affect objectivity

**Evidence:**

"From Queenstown Lakes Community Action. Republished with permission." (line 16) - Discloses authorship but provides no information about the organization.

"At Crux we have found both Mayor Lewers and Councillor Lisa Guy unusually evasive when it comes to answering actual questions, but both are very comfortable accusing us and their opponents of 'misinformation' and even 'defamation.'" (lines 11-12) - Establishes adversarial relationship.

"This is Dirty Politics and needs to be called out, using data rather than emotion." (line 14) - Crux editorial framing uses the analysis to condemn its critics.

Article published October 1, 2025, during election period, with analysis of candidates that could affect voting.

No disclosure of Queenstown Lakes Community Action's political orientation, funding, membership, or interests.

**Findings:**

The article breaches Principle 10 through inadequate disclosure of potential conflicts of interest. Readers are not provided with information about who Queenstown Lakes Community Action is, what their political orientation might be, or whether they have any electoral interests that could bias the analysis. Additionally, Crux's republication of analysis that condemns its critics (Guy and Lewers) during an election period, framed with editorial commentary calling it "Dirty Politics," creates appearance of conflict between Crux's editorial interests and journalistic objectivity. The timing during the election when the analysis could affect voting outcomes heightens the need for transparency about authorship, methodology, and potential conflicts, which is not adequately provided.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise privacy concerns. All individuals named (Mayor Glyn Lewers, Councillor Lisa Guy, Councillor Niki Gladding, mayoral candidate John Glover) are public officials or election candidates. The statements analyzed are all public statements made in their official capacities or campaign roles concerning public governance matters. The analysis concerns public political discourse, which is clearly a matter of public interest and public record.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical or mental disability. While it analyzes statements by public officials who may have various demographic characteristics, these characteristics are not gratuitously emphasized or made relevant to the coverage.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**
**Assessment:** Potential Issue

The article is presented as news analysis with scientific methodology ("data," "analysis," "coded") but contains significant interpretive and opinion elements, particularly in the Crux Editor's Note. The article is not clearly labeled as opinion or analysis, which could confuse readers about whether they are reading factual news or interpretive commentary.

The Crux Editor's Note (lines 10-16) is pure editorial opinion but is not clearly separated or labeled as such. It appears as part of the article introduction, potentially leading readers to believe these characterizations are factual foundations for the analysis rather than editorial opinion.

A clearer approach would be:
- Label the Editor's Note distinctly as "Editor's Opinion" or "Editor's Commentary"
- Label the main article as "Analysis" or "Opinion Analysis" rather than presenting it as straight news
- Clearly separate factual quotations from interpretive categorizations

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article relies on publicly available statements from named public officials and candidates. All quotes are attributed to named sources from public forums. No confidentiality issues arise.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. The statements analyzed are from public sources listed at the end (lines 121-129).

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Cannot Assess

The article references "[Graph showing analysis - see original article]" (line 77) and "[PDF Document: 112KB - Comments analysis available in original article]" (line 83), but these are not included in the text provided. Without access to the actual graph and data document, cannot assess whether they fairly represent the analysis or contain misleading visual elements.

However, the absence of the graph and detailed data in the provided text is itself problematic for verification of the claims made.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The article fails to provide fair opportunity for right of reply to Mayor Lewers and Councillor Guy regarding analysis that labels them as making "personal attacks" and engaging in "Dirty Politics" during an election. The article presents interpretive categorization as objective "data" without adequate transparency about methodology validation. The highly editorialized Crux Editor's Note prejudices readers against subjects before the analysis is presented.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The article fails to maintain clear distinction between factual information (direct quotations) and interpretive conclusions (categorization as "personal" vs. "scrutiny"). Use of "data" terminology obscures the subjective nature of categorizing political speech. The Crux Editor's Note presents editorial opinions ("Dirty Politics," "unusually evasive") as factual foundations rather than clearly labeling them as opinion.

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - BREACH**: The headline presents as objective fact ("data shows") what is actually interpretive analysis. The phrase "personal attacks" is stronger and more accusatory than the methodology's neutral category of "personal." The headline oversimplifies findings by suggesting binary difference when article acknowledges all subjects made some personal comments.

4. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - BREACH**: Inadequate disclosure about who Queenstown Lakes Community Action is, their political orientation, funding, or potential electoral interests. Crux's republication of analysis condemning its critics during an election creates appearance of conflict between editorial interests and journalistic objectivity.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This article shows several concerning patterns consistent with Crux's history of NZMC complaints:

1. **Confusion of Fact and Opinion**: As in previous upheld complaints (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940), this article presents interpretive analysis as factual reporting through use of "data" terminology while obscuring subjective judgments.

2. **Inadequate Right of Reply**: As in previous upheld complaints (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356), subjects of serious criticism are not given adequate opportunity to respond before publication.

3. **Editorial Bias**: The Crux Editor's Note demonstrates the pattern noted in Case 2895 where "opinion is liberally sprinkled through a story presented as news."

4. **Adversarial Relationship**: As noted in Case 2940's finding of "serious breakdown in professional relationship" and "festering mutual suspicion," Crux's adversarial relationship with Guy and Lewers appears to affect objectivity.

5. **Defensive Journalism**: Publishing analysis that condemns critics (Guy and Lewers) during an election, framed with editorial commentary about "Dirty Politics," suggests defensive motivation similar to patterns in Case 3356.

6. **Methodology Without Validation**: The article claims scientific rigor ("data," "analysis," "coded") without providing transparency about methodology validation, coder qualifications, or inter-rater reliability - making verification impossible.

7. **Electoral Timing**: Publishing during election period when analysis could affect voting outcomes heightens ethical obligations for fairness and accuracy.

Given ReviewContext.MD note that "Crux has a history of complaints and direction from the New Zealand Media Council" and that 60% of previous complaints were upheld, these patterns are particularly concerning as they suggest ongoing systemic issues with NZMC standards compliance.

---

**Public Interest Analysis:**

Despite the breaches identified, the article addresses matters of legitimate public interest:

1. **Political Discourse Quality**: The nature and tone of political debate during elections is relevant to voters assessing candidate temperament and approach.

2. **Accountability**: Analyzing whether political figures focus on policy/process versus personal attacks serves democratic accountability.

3. **Informed Voting**: During elections, information about how candidates conduct themselves in political discourse may be relevant to voting decisions.

4. **Transparency**: Making publicly available statements the subject of systematic analysis promotes transparency.

However, the public interest in these matters does not justify breaches of fairness and accuracy standards. The story could have been told with equal public interest impact while:
- Providing Lewers and Guy opportunity to respond to the methodology and findings
- Clearly labeling interpretive categorization as analysis rather than objective data
- Disclosing information about who Queenstown Lakes Community Action is
- Separating editorial opinion from analytical findings
- Using more precise language that acknowledges the interpretive nature of the work

The NZMC has repeatedly found (Cases 2940, 3356) that even when Crux pursues "verifiable and important" matters, "that does not detract from its obligations in relation to other stories it publishes" to meet ethical journalism standards.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are grounds for formal complaints to NZMC, most likely to be brought by Mayor Glyn Lewers and/or Councillor Lisa Guy, citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The article fails to provide fair opportunity for right of reply. Specific grounds:
   - Analysis labels Lewers and Guy as making "personal attacks" and engaging in "Dirty Politics" without giving them opportunity to respond to the methodology or findings
   - Presents interpretive categorization as objective "data" without adequate transparency about methodology validation
   - No disclosure of coder qualifications, inter-rater reliability, or systematic bias controls
   - Crux Editor's Note prejudices readers with editorial opinions before analysis is presented
   - No independent expert validation of content analysis methodology
   - No disclosure of who Queenstown Lakes Community Action is or potential political orientation

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The article fails to clearly distinguish factual information from interpretive conclusions. Specific grounds:
   - Categorizing political speech as "personal attacks" vs. "scrutiny" involves subjective interpretation but is presented as objective "data"
   - Use of scientific terminology ("coded," "analysis," "data") obscures interpretive judgments
   - Crux Editor's Note presents editorial opinions as factual foundations for analysis
   - No clear labeling of article as analysis/opinion rather than factual news

3. **Principle 6 - Headlines and Captions**: The headline presents interpretation as fact. Specific grounds:
   - "Data shows" suggests objective measurement when analysis requires subjective judgment
   - "Personal attacks" is stronger than methodology's neutral "personal" category
   - Headline oversimplifies by suggesting binary difference when article acknowledges all subjects made some personal comments

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: Inadequate disclosure of potential conflicts. Specific grounds:
   - No information about who Queenstown Lakes Community Action is, their political orientation, funding, or electoral interests
   - Crux republishes analysis condemning its critics (Guy and Lewers) during election without adequate disclosure of adversarial relationship
   - Timing during election when analysis could affect voting outcomes
   - No disclosure of whether Crux solicited or influenced the analysis

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

  - Right of reply for Lewers and Guy to respond to characterization as making "personal attacks"
  - Correction to headline to remove "data shows" definitive framing
  - Disclosure of full methodology including coder qualifications and validation measures
  - Disclosure of who Queenstown Lakes Community Action is, their funding, and any political orientation
  - Clear labeling of interpretive analysis as opinion/analysis rather than factual news
  - Separation of Crux editorial opinion from the analysis itself

**Step 2 - Escalation to NZMC (if necessary):**
- **Timing**: If no response within 10 working days, or if response is unsatisfactory
- **Deadline**: Within 20 working days of publisher's response (or non-response)
- **Method**: Online complaint form at NZMC website
- **Requirements**:
  - State principles breached (Principles 1, 4, 6, 10)
  - Provide article link and copy
  - Include initial complaint to publisher and their response
  - Provide key points in 500 words
  - Provide proper name (will be published unless exceptional circumstances)
  - Sign waiver (no other formal action regarding same article)

**Step 3 - Supporting Documentation to Gather:**
- Copy of article as published (screenshot and text)
- Copy of graph and PDF document referenced but not provided in text
- Documentation of when article was published relative to election voting period
- Any available information about Queenstown Lakes Community Action (public sources, Companies Office, etc.)
- Evidence of adversarial relationship between Crux and Guy/Lewers (previous articles, Guy's threat of Media Council complaint, Lewers' support)
- Academic or expert sources on content analysis methodology standards (to show article's methodology lacks transparency/validation)
- Previous NZMC rulings against Crux showing pattern of similar breaches

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of the decision with fair prominence in the section where original article ran

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for Mayor Lewers and Councillor Guy to respond to characterization as making "personal attacks" and engaging in "Dirty Politics," to be given fair prominence similar to original article

4. **Correction/Clarification**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Article presents interpretive analysis, not objective data
   - Categorizing political speech requires subjective judgment
   - Lewers and Guy were not given opportunity to respond to methodology or findings
   - Full methodology validation measures not disclosed
   - Queenstown Lakes Community Action's identity and potential interests not adequately disclosed
   - Crux Editor's Note contains editorial opinion that should be clearly separated from analysis

5. **Headline Correction**: Request that headline be modified to remove "data shows" definitive framing and "personal attacks" characterization, replacing with language acknowledging interpretive nature of analysis

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Standing**: Both Mayor Glyn Lewers and Councillor Lisa Guy have clear standing to bring this complaint as the primary subjects of the analysis labeling them as making "personal attacks" and engaging in "Dirty Politics." They may wish to file jointly or separately.

2. **Timing**: The complaint deadline of November 1, 2025 provides one month. However, if the election has not yet concluded, earlier action may be preferable to seek correction before voting closes. If the election is over, the damage may already be done, but complaint is still warranted to establish standards.

3. **Electoral Impact**: The article's publication during the election period is critical context. If Lewers loses the mayoral race, the article's characterization of him as making "personal attacks" may have contributed. However, NZMC addresses media ethics, not electoral outcomes.

4. **Methodology Transparency**: A key complaint ground is the lack of transparency about the content analysis methodology. Request access to the full "comments document" referenced (line 45) and the graph (line 77) to assess whether the methodology meets basic standards for credible content analysis.

5. **Queenstown Lakes Community Action**: Investigating who this organization is, who leads it, how it's funded, and whether it has political orientation or candidate preferences is essential. If the organization has political ties to Gladding, Glover, or their supporters, this would be material conflict of interest requiring disclosure.

6. **Crux Pattern**: Given ReviewContext.MD showing 60% of previous complaints against Crux were upheld, and repeated findings about confusion of fact/opinion (Cases 2891, 2895, 2940) and inadequate right of reply (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356), this article fits the established pattern of breaches.

7. **Public Interest Defense**: Crux will likely argue strong public interest in analyzing political discourse during elections. The complaint should acknowledge this legitimate interest while arguing that even important stories must meet fairness and accuracy standards.

8. **Advocacy Journalism**: Crux has previously defended breaches by claiming to do "advocacy journalism." However, NZMC has consistently ruled (Cases 2891, 2940, 3356) that advocacy journalism must still meet ethical standards - facts must be accurate, clear labeling required, and right of reply provided.

9. **Defensive Journalism**: The pattern of Crux republishing analysis that condemns its critics (Guy and Lewers who threatened/supported complaints) suggests defensive motivation. However, this is difficult to prove definitively and may be better left as context.

10. **Expert Opinion**: Consider whether to seek opinion from communication or political science scholars about whether the content analysis methodology meets academic standards. Expert critique of the methodology could strengthen the complaint.

**Review Methodology:**

This review was conducted by:
1. Close reading of the article (approximately 1,800 words)
2. Analysis against all relevant NZMC Statement of Principles
3. Review of NZMC Complaints Procedure requirements
4. Comparison with established review format and methodology
5. Review of Crux's historical NZMC complaints patterns
6. Identification of specific breaches with supporting evidence
7. Consideration of public interest and electoral context
8. Assessment of content analysis methodology transparency and validation
9. Development of actionable recommendations for formal complaint

**Objectivity and Limitations:**

This review strives to be objective and evidence-based. However, reviewers should note:
- Analysis is based on article text provided; the referenced graph and detailed methodology document were not available for review
- Review assumes article text is accurate representation of what was published
- Some judgments involve interpretation of what constitutes adequate "opportunity for response" and appropriate methodology transparency
- The substantive question of whether Lewers and Guy actually made more personal comments than Gladding and Glover is not addressed - this review focuses on media standards for how such analysis should be conducted and presented
- Without access to the full methodology document and data, cannot fully assess the rigor of the content analysis
- NZMC may weigh factors differently in adjudication
- The identity and nature of Queenstown Lakes Community Action could not be fully investigated from article alone

**Key Principles Applied in This Review:**

1. **Evidence-Based**: All breach findings cite specific passages from article
2. **Proportionate**: Distinguishes between clear breaches, potential issues, and compliant content
3. **Contextual**: Considers electoral timing, adversarial relationships, public interest, and Crux's NZMC history
4. **Practical**: Provides actionable recommendations for complaint process
5. **Balanced**: Acknowledges legitimate public interest while upholding ethical standards
6. **Methodological**: Assesses content analysis methodology against transparency and validation standards

---

**Conclusion:**

This article addresses a legitimate matter of public interest - the nature and tone of political discourse during elections - but does so in a manner that breaches NZMC standards for fairness, accuracy, and transparency. The most serious breaches are:

1. **Failure to provide adequate opportunity for right of reply** to Mayor Lewers and Councillor Guy before publishing analysis that labels them as making "personal attacks" and engaging in "Dirty Politics" during an election

2. **Presenting interpretive categorization as objective data** without adequate transparency about methodology validation, coder qualifications, or systematic bias controls

3. **Confusing fact and opinion** by using scientific terminology ("data," "analysis," "coded") to obscure the inherently subjective nature of categorizing political speech

4. **Inadequate disclosure of potential conflicts of interest** regarding who Queenstown Lakes Community Action is and Crux's adversarial relationship with subjects of criticism

The article's publication during the election period heightens these concerns, as the characterization could significantly affect voting outcomes without adequate fairness protections.

The article exemplifies patterns identified in Crux's NZMC complaint history: confusion of fact and opinion, inadequate right of reply, and defensive journalism against critics. The NZMC has repeatedly ruled that even when pursuing important public interest stories, publications must meet ethical standards of fairness and accuracy.

A formal complaint by Mayor Lewers and/or Councillor Guy would be warranted, focusing on the lack of opportunity to respond, confusion of interpretation and data, misleading headline, and inadequate conflict of interest disclosure. Such a complaint would serve the public interest by upholding standards of fair journalism, while the substantive questions about political discourse quality can be addressed through legitimate democratic debate and voter judgment.

The challenge remains: important stories about political conduct during elections can and should be told, but they must be told fairly, with clear distinction between fact and interpretation, adequate opportunity for response, and full transparency about methodology and potential conflicts of interest.
