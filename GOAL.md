The goal we are working toward is to Compele the New Zealand Media Council to Censure Crux News for it publication during the 2025 QLDC election period.

There is significant reporting with consitent breaches of the NZMC principles in many publications.  1 Compliant per article may over load the system, and appear vexatious.  We need to build a case for a pattern of breaches.

We need to identify the key principles that are being breached, and the key articles that breach them.  We need to build a case for a pattern of breaches.

The stratergy will be to make a number of compliants.  We will make a complaint for every principle.  Under each principal we will look at individual articles that breach that principle.  We will then compile a dossier of evidence for each principle.
