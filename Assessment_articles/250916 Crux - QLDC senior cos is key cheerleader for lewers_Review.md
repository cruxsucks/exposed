# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** QLDC's senior comms manager is a key cheerleader for Lewers' re-election
**Publication:** Crux
**Date:** September 16, 2025
**Author:** Peter Newport
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

## Executive Summary
This article reports on Ben Scott, QLDC's Web and Digital Communications Advisor, publicly supporting Mayor Glyn Lewers' re-election campaign through social media. The article presents this as a potential conflict of interest despite council assurances that his actions as a "private citizen" do not violate policy. The article lacks balance by failing to provide adequate right of reply to Ben Scott, includes unsubstantiated claims about his professional qualifications, and presents opinion as fact. Multiple NZMC principles appear to have been breached, particularly regarding accuracy, fairness and balance (Principle 1), distinction between fact and comment (Principle 4), and headlines (Principle 6).

## Breach Summary (NZMC)
- P1 Accuracy/Fairness/Balance — Breach
- P4 Comment vs Fact — Breach
- P6 Headlines — Breach
- P5 Opinion Identification — Potential Breach


## Article Summary
Evidence Atoms:
- [E-P1-001] "one of the most powerful members..." — elevated status asserted without evidence (Accuracy).
- [E-P1-002] "prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports" — serious claim on qualifications; no right of reply or full documentation (Fairness/Accuracy).
- [E-P1-003] "virtually every election campaign post... liked or even loved by Ben Scott" — unquantified assertion extrapolated to professional impairment (Balance/Accuracy).


The article reports that Ben Scott, described as QLDC's "main Web and Digital Communications Advisor," is publicly supporting Mayor Glyn Lewers' re-election campaign on social media. Key elements include:
- Scott is characterized as "one of the most powerful members" of QLDC's communications team
- He acts as a "highly public cheerleader" for Lewers' re-election
- The council's Deputy Electoral Officer states Scott is "acting as a private citizen" and not violating any policy
- Scott shares QLDC's official projects using the same personal social media accounts
- The article suggests Scott will find it difficult to work with anyone other than Lewers if elected
- Other Lewers supporters are characterized as "mainly his own family members, his campaign PR advisor, Skyline's Richard Thomas and various council suppliers"
- Scott's prior experience is characterized as "limited to online gaming and Esports"
- The article questions whether CEO Mike Theelen will take action despite acknowledging Scott may not technically breach council rules

The article is labeled "Analysis" and raises questions about the appropriateness of a senior council communications staff member publicly supporting a mayoral candidate.

---

## Context Considerations
The ReviewContext.MD indicates that Queenstown Lakes Local Government Elections are underway, with Crux being a local news site reporting on QLDC matters. This electoral context is critical - the article is published during an active election period (September 16, 2025) with voting closing October 11, 2025.

The article references a controversial council meeting that "stripped Councillor Niki Gladding of her committee roles for revealing the council's then secret plans to discharge semi-treated sewage direct into the Shotover River" (line 21-22), providing broader context about council dynamics and ongoing controversies.

The electoral context heightens the importance of fairness and accuracy, as claims about conflicts of interest and professional qualifications during an election period can significantly impact public perception and electoral outcomes.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**
The article presents several claims that are unverified or misleading:

1. "One of the most powerful members of the Queenstown Lakes District Council's communications team" (line 9) - No evidence provided to substantiate this characterization of Scott's power or influence within the organization. The article later describes him as "the council's main Web and Digital Communications Advisor" (line 11), which is a Web and Digital Communications Advisor position, not necessarily "one of the most powerful members."

2. "Mr Scott's seniority in the QLDC's management and communications team was evident from the minutes for the meeting that controversially stripped Councillor Niki Gladding of her committee roles" (line 21-22) - The article does not provide the actual evidence from these minutes or explain what made his seniority "evident." Readers cannot verify this claim.

3. "In spite of Mr Scott's senior position in the QLDC communications team, his prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports" (line 29-30) - This is a serious allegation about professional qualifications that is:
   - Presented without verification or documentation
   - Followed by a LinkedIn screenshot as "source" (line 32) but without explaining what the screenshot shows
   - Phrased as established fact ("is limited to") rather than an assessment
   - Potentially misleading if Scott has other relevant experience not mentioned

4. "Virtually every election campaign post from Glyn Lewers, on Facebook and LinkedIn, has been liked or even loved by Ben Scott" (line 24) - The word "virtually" is vague and unquantified. Has the author reviewed all posts systematically?

**Fairness Issues:**
The article is fundamentally unfair to Ben Scott:

1. **Insufficient Right of Reply:** Scott is the primary subject of criticism but is not given adequate opportunity to respond. The article includes a statement from the council's Deputy Electoral Officer (Jane Robertson) defending Scott's actions (lines 16-18), but Scott himself is not quoted or given the opportunity to explain:
   - His understanding of council policy on political activity
   - His reasoning for his social media activity
   - His perspective on how this affects his professional role
   - His response to claims about his professional experience
   - His view on whether this creates conflicts of interest

2. **Professional Reputation Attack:** The claim that his "prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports" (line 29-30) is a serious attack on Scott's professional qualifications and competence. Without his response or fuller context of his experience, this is unfair.

3. **Characterization Without Evidence:** Scott is described as a "highly public cheerleader" (line 9-10) and the article suggests he will find it "difficult for him to work with anyone, apart from Lewers, who is elected mayor" (line 24-25). These are serious allegations about his professional judgment and future conduct, presented without evidence beyond social media "likes."

**Balance Issues:**
The article lacks balance in several ways:

1. **No Independent Assessment:** The article presents no independent expert opinion on:
   - Whether Scott's actions actually constitute a conflict of interest
   - What standard practice is for council employees' political activity
   - How other councils handle similar situations
   - Whether the council's policy is adequate or common

2. **One-Sided Electoral Impact:** The article suggests Scott's support might be problematic but provides no balancing perspective on:
   - Whether public servants commonly support candidates as private citizens
   - The distinction between personal political expression and official conduct
   - Whether Scott's social media activity has any actual impact on his work

3. **Loaded Context:** The article notes "the other people supporting Glyn Lewers campaign online are mainly his own family members, his campaign PR advisor, Skyline's Richard Thomas and various council suppliers" (line 27-28). This context seems designed to suggest Lewers has limited legitimate support, which is editorial commentary not balanced reporting.

**Evidence:**

"One of the most powerful members of the Queenstown Lakes District Council's communications team is acting as a highly public cheerleader for the re-election of Mayor Glyn Lewers." (lines 9-10) - No evidence provided for "most powerful" characterization.

"In spite of Mr Scott's senior position in the QLDC communications team, his prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports." (lines 29-30) - Serious claim about professional qualifications without Scott's response or full verification.

"Virtually every election campaign post from Glyn Lewers, on Facebook and LinkedIn, has been liked or even loved by Ben Scott, surely making it difficult for him to work with anyone, apart from Lewers, who is elected mayor on October 11." (lines 24-25) - Speculative claim about future conduct presented as logical conclusion.

"It is also noteworthy that the other people supporting Glyn Lewers campaign online are mainly his own family members, his campaign PR advisor, Skyline's Richard Thomas and various council suppliers." (lines 27-28) - Editorial commentary disguised as observation.

**Findings:**
This article breaches Principle 1 through insufficient accuracy, fairness to Ben Scott, and lack of balance. While the article raises legitimate questions about potential conflicts of interest, it does so in a way that:
- Attacks Scott's professional reputation without adequate right of reply
- Presents unverified claims as fact
- Speculates about future conduct without evidence
- Provides editorial commentary disguised as news reporting
- Lacks independent expert perspective on the actual conflict of interest question

The article's timing during an election period makes these breaches particularly serious, as they could influence electoral outcomes while denying the primary subject fair opportunity to respond.

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The article is labeled "Analysis" (line 7), which signals it may contain opinion and interpretation. However, even analysis requires clear distinction between factual information and opinion/interpretation. This article systematically fails to maintain that distinction.

**Fact vs. Opinion Confusion:**

1. "One of the most powerful members" (line 9) - Opinion presented as fact. No objective measure of "power" is provided.

2. "Highly public cheerleader" (line 10) - Characterization presented as fact rather than interpretation of social media activity.

3. "His prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports" (line 29-30) - Assessment presented as established fact without full documentation of his experience.

4. "Surely making it difficult for him to work with anyone, apart from Lewers, who is elected mayor" (line 24-25) - Speculation presented as logical conclusion. The word "surely" suggests this is obvious fact rather than the author's opinion.

5. "Even though he might not technically be in breach of council rules, his actions seem quite ill-advised, to put it politely" (line 34) - This is clearly the author's opinion, appropriately qualified by "seem," but it follows a pattern of presenting opinions as facts throughout the article.

**Lack of Clear Identification:**

While the article is labeled "Analysis," this label is not sufficient to excuse the systematic presentation of opinion as fact. Analysis should still clearly distinguish between:
- Verified facts (what Scott actually did)
- The author's interpretation (what this means)
- The author's opinion (whether this is appropriate)

The article blurs these categories throughout. For example:
- Fact: Scott liked/loved Lewers' campaign posts on social media
- Interpretation: This makes him a "highly public cheerleader"
- Opinion: This is "quite ill-advised"

The article presents all three as fact or logical conclusion rather than clearly identifying the interpretation and opinion elements.

**Factual Foundation:**

Several opinions lack proper factual foundation:

1. "Most powerful members" - No definition or evidence of power
2. "Prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports" - LinkedIn screenshot cited as source (line 32) but not explained or fully documented
3. "Difficult for him to work with anyone, apart from Lewers" - No evidence that Scott's social media activity affects his professional conduct
4. "Mainly his own family members, his campaign PR advisor, Skyline's Richard Thomas and various council suppliers" - Presented as fact but no systematic evidence of who supports Lewers online

**Evidence:**

"Analysis." (line 7) - This label signals opinion/interpretation content, but does not excuse presenting opinion as fact.

"One of the most powerful members of the Queenstown Lakes District Council's communications team" (line 9) - Opinion about status/power presented as fact.

"Ben Scott is the council's main Web and Digital Communications Advisor" (line 11) - This appears to be fact about his job title, but "main" is characterization.

"Surely making it difficult for him to work with anyone, apart from Lewers, who is elected mayor" (line 24-25) - Speculation presented as logical conclusion via "surely."

"His prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports. Source: LinkedIn." (lines 29-32) - Assessment presented as fact with minimal documentation.

"His actions seem quite ill-advised, to put it politely." (line 34) - This is clearly opinion, but only one instance of clear opinion language in an article that consistently presents opinion as fact.

**Findings:**
The article breaches Principle 4 by failing to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion/interpretation. While labeled "Analysis," the article systematically presents interpretations and opinions as established facts:
- Characterizations of Scott's power and role presented as fact
- Assessments of his professional experience presented as fact
- Speculations about future conduct presented as logical conclusion
- Editorial commentary disguised as factual observation

Even "Analysis" pieces must distinguish between fact and interpretation. This article should have more clearly separated:
- What actually happened (Scott liked Lewers' social media posts; council says no policy violation)
- The author's interpretation (this creates appearance of conflict)
- The author's opinion (this is inappropriate/ill-advised)

The "Analysis" label provides some notice to readers, but does not excuse the systematic presentation of opinion as fact throughout the article.

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**
The article is labeled "Analysis" (line 7), which provides some signal that this is not straight news reporting. However, "Analysis" is ambiguous - it could mean analytical reporting based on facts, or it could mean opinion/commentary.

The article is bylined "by Peter Newport - Sep 16, 2025" (line 3) in standard news format. There is no clear indication this is a personal opinion column or editorial, as opposed to analytical reporting.

**Foundation of Fact:**
Even if treated as opinion/analysis content, the article has weaknesses in factual foundation:

1. The characterization of Scott as "one of the most powerful members" lacks evidentiary support
2. The claim that his "prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports" references LinkedIn as source but doesn't fully document his experience
3. The assertion about who supports Lewers online ("mainly his own family members, his campaign PR advisor, Skyline's Richard Thomas and various council suppliers") is not systematically verified
4. The claim about Scott's "seniority" being "evident from the minutes" does not provide the actual evidence from those minutes

**Balance Requirement:**
Principle 5 states "with comment and opinion balance is not essential." However, this article occupies a gray area:
- It's labeled "Analysis" not "Opinion" or "Column"
- It reports news (Scott's social media activity, council's response) mixed with opinion/interpretation
- The lack of balance would be acceptable for clearly-labeled opinion but is problematic for what appears to be analytical reporting

**Evidence:**

"Analysis." (line 7) - This label provides some indication of opinion/interpretation content, but is ambiguous.

"by Peter Newport - Sep 16, 2025" (line 3) - Standard news byline format, not opinion column identification.

The article structure mixes factual reporting (council's statement) with opinion/interpretation (characterizations of Scott's role and qualifications) without clear delineation.

**Findings:**
The article constitutes a potential breach of Principle 5. The "Analysis" label provides some notice that this contains opinion/interpretation, but:
- "Analysis" is ambiguous and could mean analytical reporting rather than opinion column
- The article is not clearly identified as a personal opinion piece or column
- The factual foundation for several key claims is inadequate
- The article would benefit from clearer labeling (e.g., "Opinion," "Commentary," or "Analysis and Opinion") to help readers understand they are reading the author's interpretations and opinions about a conflict of interest question, not objective reporting of an established conflict

If the article had been clearly labeled as an opinion column or commentary piece, many concerns about balance and fact/opinion distinction might be mitigated. However, because it presents as analytical reporting with the "Analysis" label being the only signal, it cannot fully claim the protection of Principle 5.

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "QLDC's senior comms manager is a key cheerleader for Lewers' re-election"

**Accuracy Assessment:**

The headline contains several accuracy issues:

1. **"Senior comms manager"** - The article describes Scott as "the council's main Web and Digital Communications Advisor" (line 11). The headline upgrades this to "senior comms manager," which:
   - Changes "advisor" to "manager" (different role/seniority)
   - Adds "senior" characterization
   - Uses "comms manager" as shorthand that may overstate his position

   While the article does characterize him as having "seniority" (line 21) and being "one of the most powerful members" (line 9), his actual title appears to be "Web and Digital Communications Advisor," not "senior comms manager."

2. **"Key cheerleader"** - The headline presents as fact that Scott is a "key cheerleader." The article uses "highly public cheerleader" (line 10) and describes him liking/loving social media posts. But "key cheerleader" suggests he plays a significant role in the campaign, which is:
   - The author's interpretation, not established fact
   - Not supported by evidence in the article beyond social media likes
   - Potentially more inflammatory than "highly public cheerleader" used in the article

**Misleading Elements:**

The headline misleads readers by:
1. Overstating Scott's job title/seniority ("senior comms manager" vs. "Web and Digital Communications Advisor")
2. Presenting interpretation ("key cheerleader") as fact
3. Not signaling this is analysis/opinion rather than factual reporting
4. Creating impression of more serious conflict than article establishes (social media likes vs. active campaign role)

**Substance Reflection:**

The headline does reflect the article's core content - that a QLDC communications staff member is publicly supporting Lewers' campaign. However, it:
- Exaggerates his position ("senior comms manager")
- Characterizes his role ("key cheerleader") more strongly than justified
- Fails to signal the "Analysis" nature of the piece
- Does not convey that council says no policy violation occurred

A more accurate headline would be:
- "QLDC comms advisor publicly supports Lewers re-election campaign"
- "Council staff member's support for Lewers raises questions"
- "Analysis: QLDC employee's campaign support prompts conflict questions"

**Evidence:**

Headline: "QLDC's senior comms manager is a key cheerleader for Lewers' re-election" (line 2)

Article text: "Ben Scott is the council's main Web and Digital Communications Advisor" (line 11) - His actual title, not "senior comms manager"

Article text: "One of the most powerful members of the Queenstown Lakes District Council's communications team is acting as a highly public cheerleader" (lines 9-10) - Article uses "highly public cheerleader," headline upgrades to "key cheerleader"

Article text: "Analysis." (line 7) - Article labeled as analysis, but headline does not signal this

**Findings:**
The headline breaches Principle 6 by:
1. Inaccurately representing Scott's job title, upgrading "Web and Digital Communications Advisor" to "senior comms manager"
2. Presenting interpretation ("key cheerleader") as established fact
3. Failing to signal the analytical/opinion nature of the piece
4. Overstating the severity of the situation compared to what the article establishes

Headlines must "accurately and fairly convey the substance or a key element of the report." This headline exaggerates both Scott's position and his role in the campaign, while failing to signal that the article is analysis/opinion rather than factual reporting of an established conflict of interest.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

**Disclosure Requirements:**

The article discloses the electoral context adequately:
- Published during election period (September 16, 2025)
- Notes voting closes October 11, 2025 (line 25)
- Clearly identifies this is about re-election campaign

**Author-Subject Relationship:**

There is no indication of any relationship between author Peter Newport and either:
- Ben Scott (the subject)
- Mayor Glyn Lewers (the candidate)
- QLDC or other parties mentioned

The article appears to be independent reporting/analysis of a matter of public interest.

**Sponsorship/Inducement:**

There is no suggestion of any financial inducement, sponsorship, or conflict of interest on the part of the author or publication.

**Public Interest:**

The article addresses a legitimate public interest issue:
- Appropriateness of council employees publicly supporting candidates
- Potential conflicts of interest in local government
- Electoral integrity and independence of council staff

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 10. The article appears to be independent journalism addressing a legitimate public interest matter during an election period. While the article has other issues (accuracy, fairness, fact/opinion distinction), there is no evidence of undisclosed conflicts of interest by the author or publication.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise privacy concerns. All individuals named (Ben Scott, Mayor Glyn Lewers, Jane Robertson, Mike Theelen, Richard Thomas) are either:
- Public officials engaged in public roles (Scott, Lewers, Robertson, Theelen)
- Individuals publicly supporting a political campaign (Thomas)

The matters discussed relate to:
- Public political activity on social media
- Council employment and policies
- Electoral campaigns - all matters of public record and public interest

Scott's employment history referenced via LinkedIn (line 32) is information he has made publicly available on a professional networking platform.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2. All information relates to public officials, public political activity, and matters of public interest.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical/mental disability. The criticism of Scott relates to his professional role and political activity, not any personal characteristics.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article does not appear to rely on confidential sources. The council's statement is attributed to Jane Robertson, and other information appears to be from public sources (social media, LinkedIn, council minutes). No confidentiality issues arise.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. The information appears to come from public sources (social media, LinkedIn, council statement).

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text references "Source: LinkedIn" (line 32) suggesting a screenshot or graphic is included, but without seeing the actual graphic, cannot fully assess. No obvious issues are apparent from the text provided.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The article presents unverified claims as fact (Scott's power/seniority, his professional experience being "limited to online gaming and Esports"), fails to provide adequate right of reply to Ben Scott (the primary subject of criticism), and lacks balance through absence of independent expert assessment of the conflict of interest question. The attack on Scott's professional qualifications without his response or full documentation is particularly unfair.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: Despite being labeled "Analysis," the article systematically presents opinions and interpretations as facts. Characterizations of Scott's power, role, and professional background are presented as established facts rather than the author's assessments. Speculation about his future ability to work with non-Lewers mayors is presented as logical conclusion.

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - BREACH**: The headline inaccurately represents Scott's job title (upgrading "Web and Digital Communications Advisor" to "senior comms manager"), presents interpretation as fact ("key cheerleader"), and fails to signal the analytical/opinion nature of the piece.

4. **Principle 5 (Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: While labeled "Analysis," this label is ambiguous and insufficient to clearly identify the piece as opinion/commentary rather than analytical reporting. The factual foundation for several key claims is inadequate.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

While this is a single article review, several concerning patterns are evident:

1. **Insufficient Right of Reply:** Despite Ben Scott being the primary subject, he is not given adequate opportunity to respond to serious allegations about his professional qualifications and judgment. The council's statement defends the legality of his actions but does not address the broader fairness or professional reputation issues.

2. **Opinion as Fact:** Throughout the article, there is a consistent pattern of presenting the author's interpretations and opinions as factual findings:
   - "Most powerful members" - opinion stated as fact
   - "Prior experience is limited to" - assessment stated as fact
   - "Key/highly public cheerleader" - interpretation stated as fact
   - "Surely making it difficult" - speculation stated as conclusion

3. **Professional Reputation Attack:** The claim about Scott's experience being "limited to online gaming and Esports" is a serious attack on his professional competence that:
   - Lacks adequate documentation
   - Denies Scott opportunity to respond
   - May be misleading if context is omitted
   - Is presented as established fact

4. **Electoral Context:** Published during an active election (voting closes October 11, 2025), the article potentially impacts:
   - Public perception of Mayor Lewers' campaign
   - Ben Scott's professional reputation
   - Voter confidence in council administration

5. **Genre Confusion:** The "Analysis" label signals some opinion/interpretation, but the article systematically presents opinions as facts, creating confusion about whether readers are receiving factual reporting or the author's views.

If this pattern extends to other Crux coverage of QLDC matters, it would raise questions about the publication's commitment to fairness, accuracy, and clear distinction between fact and opinion.

---

**Electoral Context:**

This article's publication during the 2025 QLDC election (voting closes October 11, 2025) has several implications:

1. **Impact on Electoral Perception:** The article could influence voter perceptions of:
   - Mayor Lewers' campaign (suggesting limited legitimate support)
   - Council administration (suggesting inappropriate political activity)
   - Electoral integrity (raising conflict of interest questions)

2. **Fairness During Elections:** Electoral periods require heightened attention to fairness because of direct impact on democratic outcomes. The failure to provide Ben Scott adequate right of reply to serious allegations about his professional qualifications is particularly problematic during an election.

3. **Public Interest Justification:** The article addresses a legitimate public interest issue - whether council employees should publicly support candidates. However, this public interest does not excuse:
   - Unverified claims about professional qualifications
   - Inadequate right of reply
   - Presentation of opinion as fact

4. **Potential Electoral Impact:** While the article focuses on a council employee rather than candidates directly, it could influence the election by:
   - Suggesting inappropriate relationships between council staff and the mayor
   - Raising questions about Lewers' support base
   - Affecting voter confidence in council administration

The electoral timing does not create the breaches but makes them more serious, as inaccurate or unfair reporting during elections can directly impact democratic outcomes.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The article fails to provide adequate right of reply to Ben Scott and presents unverified claims as fact. Specific grounds:
   - Scott not given opportunity to respond to allegation his "prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports"
   - Scott not given opportunity to respond to characterization as "key/highly public cheerleader"

   - Assessment of his professional experience presented as fact ("is limited to")
   - Speculation about future conduct presented as logical conclusion ("surely making it difficult")
   - "Analysis" label insufficient to excuse systematic presentation of opinion as fact

3. **Principle 6 - Headlines and Captions**: The headline inaccurately represents facts and presents opinion as fact. Specific grounds:
   - Job title changed from "Web and Digital Communications Advisor" to "senior comms manager"
   - Interpretation ("key cheerleader") presented as fact
   - Headline fails to signal analytical/opinion nature of piece
   - Exaggerates severity compared to article content

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 5 - Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters**: The article is not clearly identified as opinion content despite functioning as such, and lacks adequate factual foundation for key claims.

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Lack of Right of Reply - Professional Qualifications:**
   - "In spite of Mr Scott's senior position in the QLDC communications team, his prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports." (lines 29-30) - Serious allegation about professional qualifications without Scott's response or full documentation

2. **Unverified Claims:**
   - "One of the most powerful members of the Queenstown Lakes District Council's communications team" (line 9) - No evidence provided for this characterization
   - "Mr Scott's seniority in the QLDC's management and communications team was evident from the minutes" (lines 21-22) - Claims evidence but doesn't provide it

3. **Opinion Presented as Fact:**
   - Headline: "QLDC's senior comms manager is a key cheerleader for Lewers' re-election" - Opinion/interpretation stated as fact, job title exaggerated
   - "Virtually every election campaign post from Glyn Lewers, on Facebook and LinkedIn, has been liked or even loved by Ben Scott, surely making it difficult for him to work with anyone, apart from Lewers, who is elected mayor" (lines 24-25) - Speculation presented as logical conclusion

4. **Inadequate Factual Foundation:**
   - "His prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports. Source: LinkedIn." (lines 29-32) - Source cited but not explained or documented
   - "It is also noteworthy that the other people supporting Glyn Lewers campaign online are mainly his own family members, his campaign PR advisor, Skyline's Richard Thomas and various council suppliers" (lines 27-28) - Editorial commentary without systematic verification

5. **Ambiguous Labeling:**
   - "Analysis." (line 7) - Label is ambiguous and does not clearly identify piece as opinion/commentary
   - "by Peter Newport - Sep 16, 2025" (line 3) - Standard news byline format, not opinion column identification

  - Include initial complaint to publisher and their response
  - Provide key points in 500 words
  - Provide proper name (will be published unless exceptional circumstances)
  - Sign waiver (no other formal action regarding same article)

**Step 3 - Supporting Documentation to Gather:**
- Copy of article as published (screenshot and text)
- Ben Scott's actual LinkedIn profile showing his full professional experience
- Documentation of his actual job title from QLDC
- Council minutes referenced in the article (if accessible)
- Any other Crux articles showing pattern of similar issues

---

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of the decision with fair prominence in the section where original article ran

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for Ben Scott to respond to allegations about his professional qualifications and explain his understanding of his political activity, to be given fair prominence similar to original article

4. **Correction/Retraction**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Article failed to provide adequate right of reply to Ben Scott
   - Claims about professional experience being "limited to online gaming and Esports" were not adequately verified
   - Headline misrepresented his job title
   - Article should have more clearly distinguished between facts and author's opinions/interpretations
   - "Analysis" label should have been clearer or article should be labeled as opinion/commentary

5. **Process Improvements**: Request Crux establish clear editorial policies for:
   - Mandatory right of reply when professional qualifications are questioned
   - Clear distinction between fact and opinion even in "Analysis" pieces
   - Accurate representation of job titles and professional credentials
   - Clear labeling of opinion vs. news vs. analysis content

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Standing**: Consider who should bring complaint:
   - Ben Scott (directly criticized, professional reputation attacked)
   - Third-party community member concerned about journalistic standards
   - NZMC will consider third-party complaints but may require Scott's consent given personal nature of allegations

2. **Timing is Critical**: The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher is October 16, 2025

3. **Public Interest**: This complaint serves public interest by:
   - Protecting professional reputations from unfair attacks
   - Ensuring right of reply for those criticized
   - Maintaining clear distinction between fact and opinion
   - Holding media accountable for accuracy in electoral journalism

4. **Pattern Evidence**: If pursuing complaint, investigate whether:
   - Crux has pattern of making unverified claims about professional qualifications
   - Other articles show similar failures to provide right of reply
   - Other articles systematically present opinion as fact despite "Analysis" labels
   - This relates to broader pattern identified in ReviewContext.MD of NZMC complaints against Crux

5. **Severity Assessment**: The most serious breach is the attack on Scott's professional qualifications ("prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports") without:
   - Adequate verification/documentation
   - Right of reply
   - Full context of his experience

   This type of professional reputation attack requires particularly strong fairness protections.

6. **Broader Implications**: This complaint could establish precedent for:
   - Right of reply requirements when professional qualifications questioned
   - Standards for "Analysis" labeling and fact/opinion distinction
   - Accuracy requirements for characterizing job titles and experience
   - Fair comment doctrine in electoral contexts

- Some judgments involve interpretation of editorial intent and effect
- Without seeing Ben Scott's full LinkedIn profile, cannot definitively assess whether "limited to online gaming and Esports" is accurate or misleading
- NZMC may weigh factors differently in adjudication

**Key Principles Applied in This Review:**

1. **Evidence-Based**: All breach findings cite specific passages from article
2. **Proportionate**: Distinguishes between clear breaches, potential breaches, and compliant content
3. **Contextual**: Considers electoral timing and public interest implications
4. **Practical**: Provides actionable recommendations for complaint process
5. **Balanced**: Acknowledges the legitimate public interest in the conflict of interest question while identifying fairness and accuracy failures

---

**Conclusion:**

This article raises a legitimate public interest question about potential conflicts of interest when council employees publicly support political candidates. However, it does so in a manner that breaches multiple NZMC principles:

1. It attacks Ben Scott's professional qualifications without adequate verification, documentation, or right of reply
2. It systematically presents opinions and interpretations as facts despite the "Analysis" label
3. Its headline misrepresents Scott's job title and presents interpretation as fact
4. It lacks the factual foundation and clear labeling appropriate for opinion/analysis content

The most serious breach is the claim that Scott's "prior experience is limited to online gaming and Esports" - a damaging allegation about professional competence made without his response or full documentation. This type of professional reputation attack requires particularly strong fairness protections.

A formal complaint is warranted, focusing on:
- The right of reply violation regarding professional qualifications
- The systematic presentation of opinion as fact
- The headline inaccuracy regarding job title
- The inadequate factual foundation for key claims

The complaint serves not only to address this specific article but to establish important precedents for fair reporting on professional qualifications and clear distinction between fact and opinion in electoral journalism.
