# NZMC Standards Review
**Article:** Lisa Guy: questions over CEO recruitment 'disrespectful and inaccurate.'
**Publication:** Crux
**Date:** September 22, 2025
**Author:** Peter Newport
**Review Date:** October 3, 2025

---

## Executive Summary
This article presents correspondence between Councillor Lisa Guy and mayoral candidate John Glover regarding the secretive recruitment of a replacement QLDC CEO during an election period. While the article publishes both parties' views, it lacks critical journalistic analysis, context, and independent verification of key claims. The article appears to breach NZMC Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) through lack of context and independent reporting, and Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) by presenting unverified claims as fact without proper scrutiny or verification.

---

## Article Summary
The article reports on an exchange between Councillor Lisa Guy and mayoral candidate John Glover concerning the QLDC's CEO recruitment process occurring during the election period. The article:
- Opens with Guy's accusation that Gladding made "allegations that are both inaccurate and outside the standards of respectful governance"
- Notes that both Niki Gladding and John Glover have raised questions about Mayor Lewer's behind-closed-doors CEO recruitment
- Provides context about the three-person committee (Guy, Cocks, Lewers) that oversees CEO pay/performance and awarded a 15% pay rise amid declining trust
- References QLDC's poor record on LGOIMA compliance (80% of Ombudsman complaints finding wrongful withholding)
- Publishes Lisa Guy's full email to John Glover defending the recruitment process
- Publishes John Glover's full reply challenging the process and calling for it to be paused
- Notes Guy appears not to have copied media, unlike Glover

The article publishes both parties' positions but provides no independent reporting on: the actual recruitment process details, verification of competing claims, council policies cited, the Auditor General guidance referenced, or perspectives from other key parties (Mayor Lewers, CEO Theelen, other councillors, Niki Gladding).

---

## Context Considerations
ReviewContext.MD indicates this article is published during the Queenstown Lake Local Government Elections (election date October 11, 2025, per the article). This electoral context is critical as:

1. **Electoral Timing**: The article is published 19 days before the election, with John Glover identified as a "mayoral candidate" actively challenging incumbent practices.

2. **Campaign Significance**: The CEO recruitment controversy is a major election issue, with Glover and Gladding (both candidates) raising concerns about process, timing, and transparency.

3. **Committee Composition**: The three-person committee controlling CEO recruitment (Guy, Cocks, Lewers) forms part of the incumbent power structure being challenged in the election.

4. **Trust Context**: The article references QLDC's "all time low" community trust and 80% Ombudsman finding rate against the council on LGOIMA - establishing low public confidence in council transparency.

5. **Previous Coverage**: The article references Niki Gladding's "recent social-media opinions" about the CEO recruitment, indicating ongoing public controversy that predates this article.

This electoral context heightens the need for balanced, fact-checked journalism that helps voters understand the substantive issues rather than simply publishing competing campaign claims.

## NZMC Standards Analysis

### Principle 1: Accuracy, Fairness and Balance
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

**Accuracy Issues:**
The article presents multiple claims as established fact without verification or context:

1. **LGOIMA Compliance Claim**: "80% of complaints to the Chief Ombudsman have found QLDC to have wrongfully withheld LGOIMA information." (line 13)
   - This is a serious statistical claim presented as fact
   - No source, timeframe, or verification provided
   - No context about total number of complaints or what this percentage represents
   - This appears to be editorial assertion rather than verified reporting

2. **"Secretive" Recruitment**: The article characterizes the recruitment as "early, secretive recruitment" (line 9) and Glover refers to "secretive, exclusive process behind closed doors" (line 53)
   - The article does not independently verify whether the process is actually "secretive" or follows normal council practice
   - Guy's email explains delegations and standard procurement processes - the article provides no independent assessment of whether her description or Glover's is accurate

3. **Pay Rise Context**: "awarded Mr Theelen a 15% pay rise last year at the same time as the council's own community trust and satisfaction survey dropped to an all time low" (lines 11-12)
   - This juxtaposition implies causation or inappropriateness but provides no context about:
     - Whether the pay rise was part of contracted arrangements
     - How CEO performance was actually assessed
     - What other councils pay their CEOs
     - The actual survey results and methodology

4. **Auditor General Guidance**: Glover cites specific sections (5.14-5.16, 5.21, 5.22, 5.34) of Office of the Auditor General guidance (lines 57-58)
   - The article does not verify these citations
   - Does not provide the actual guidance text
   - Does not independently assess whether the current process complies or violates this guidance
   - Readers cannot evaluate whether Glover's characterization is accurate

5. **Delegation Authority**: Guy claims "Authority to procure an external recruitment firm sits with Council staff, not the CE Performance Review Committee, nor individual Councillors" (line 27)
   - This is a factual claim about council delegations
   - The article provides no independent verification from council policies or the Local Government Act
   - No assessment of whether this delegation is appropriate or unusual

**Fairness Issues:**
The article is unfair in several ways:

1. **Missing Voices**: Critical parties are not given opportunity to comment:
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers: Leader of the recruitment process, directly criticized by both Guy and Glover, not contacted for comment
   - Councillor Cocks: The third member of the CE Performance Review Committee, no perspective provided
   - Niki Gladding: Guy accuses her of making "allegations that are both inaccurate and outside the standards of respectful governance" (line 7) - Gladding's actual allegations are not presented and she's not given right of reply to Guy's characterization
   - CEO Mike Theelen: His job is being recruited for, his pay rise is criticized - no comment sought
   - Council's Procurement Manager: Guy references this person leading the process - no verification or comment

2. **Unequal Framing**:
   - Guy is characterized as "accusing" Gladding (line 6) in the opening sentence, creating negative framing
   - The article notes Guy "appears not to have copied any media" (line 17) while Glover did - implying Guy sought less transparency, though this could equally mean Guy was attempting private resolution
   - Guy's email signature "Sent from my I -Phone, On the move, On a Sunday" (line 41) is included, which could be seen as mocking or diminishing her response

3. **Context Gaps**:
   - No explanation of what Gladding's actual social media posts said
   - No history of how this controversy emerged
   - No explanation of normal CEO recruitment processes for comparison
   - No context on whether recruitment during election periods is actually problematic (beyond Glover's citation)

**Balance Issues:**

1. **Document Dump Without Analysis**: The article essentially dumps two emails without journalistic analysis, verification, or independent reporting. This is not balance - it's abdication of journalistic responsibility.

2. **Missing Perspectives**: Beyond the Guy-Glover exchange, the article provides no:
   - Expert opinion on local government recruitment practices
   - Legal analysis of delegation authorities
   - Comparison to other councils' practices
   - Assessment of the Auditor General guidance cited
   - Perspective from governance or local government experts

3. **No Independent Fact-Checking**: The article makes no effort to verify competing claims:
   - Guy says the process follows "QLDC's established policies and the Local Government Act" - is this true?
   - Glover says there's "no reason for a secretive, exclusive process" - is the process actually secretive or is it following normal public-excluded employment procedures?
   - Guy says she's "confident those records will confirm the process has been transparent and robust" - can this be verified?
   - Glover cites specific Auditor General guidance - does the current process actually violate it?

4. **Electoral Context Imbalance**: The article identifies Glover as "mayoral candidate" (line 9) but doesn't identify:
   - Whether Guy is seeking re-election
   - Whether Cocks is seeking re-election
   - Whether Lewers is seeking re-election as mayor
   - What Gladding's electoral status is

   This incomplete electoral context prevents readers from fully understanding the political dynamics at play.

**Evidence:**

"80% of complaints to the Chief Ombudsman have found QLDC to have wrongfully withheld LGOIMA information." (line 13) - Serious statistical claim with no source, timeframe, or verification.

"It was this group that awarded Mr Theelen a 15% pay rise last year at the same time as the council's own community trust and satisfaction survey dropped to an all time low." (lines 11-12) - Presented as fact without verification of the pay rise amount, survey results, or causal relationship.

"Councillor Lisa Guy has accused Councillor Niki Gladding of making 'allegations that are both inaccurate and outside the standards of respectful governance'" (lines 6-7) - Gladding's actual allegations are never presented, denying readers ability to assess Guy's characterization.

"Further, suggesting that anyone who wants information - including presumably Councillors will need to do so under the sluggish LGOIMA official information mechanisms is frankly ridiculous." (lines 54-55) - Glover's characterization of LGOIMA as "sluggish" and Guy's position as "frankly ridiculous" is presented without verification of what Guy actually said or what LGOIMA timelines actually are.

**Findings:**
This article constitutes a breach of Principle 1. While it publishes both Guy's and Glover's positions, this is insufficient for balance. The article fails in accuracy by presenting unverified claims as fact, fails in fairness by omitting key voices (Mayor Lewers, Gladding, Cocks, Theelen) and providing unequal framing, and fails in balance by providing no independent reporting, fact-checking, or expert context. The article reads as stenography of a political dispute rather than journalism. During an election period, this failure is particularly serious as voters need verified facts and comprehensive context, not just competing campaign claims.

---

### Principle 4: Comment and Fact
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The article systematically fails to distinguish between factual information and opinion/characterization:

**Fact vs. Opinion/Characterization Confusion:**

1. **"Secretive" Characterization**: The article's opening describes "early, secretive recruitment" (line 9) and later refers to "behind closed doors work" (line 9)
   - These are characterizations, not established facts
   - Guy's email suggests this follows normal delegation and public-excluded employment procedures
   - The article does not establish whether the process is actually "secretive" compared to normal practice or inappropriately secret
   - Presenting this as fact rather than disputed characterization is misleading

2. **"Everything is transparent"**: The article states Guy says "everything is transparent" (line 13) but this appears to be paraphrase rather than direct quote
   - It's not marked as a quote
   - It's immediately followed by "she urges Mr Glover to apply for documents under LGOIMA" which contradicts the claimed transparency
   - This creates confusion about what Guy actually said versus editorial characterization

3. **LGOIMA Statistics**: "80% of complaints to the Chief Ombudsman have found QLDC to have wrongfully withheld LGOIMA information" (line 13)
   - Presented as fact in editorial voice
   - No source attribution
   - Could be fact or could be opinion/estimate - impossible for readers to know

4. **Pay Rise Context**: "awarded Mr Theelen a 15% pay rise last year at the same time as the council's own community trust and satisfaction survey dropped to an all time low" (lines 11-12)
   - The pay rise amount is presented as fact without source
   - "All time low" is presented as fact without citation of survey or results
   - The temporal juxtaposition ("at the same time as") implies causation or poor judgment - this is comment disguised as fact

5. **Editorial Characterizations**:
   - "questions" vs. "allegations" - Guy characterizes Gladding's statements as "allegations" while the article uses "questions" for both Gladding and Glover
   - "disrespectful and inaccurate" - Guy's characterization presented without verification
   - "ill-timed, inappropriate, ill-advised and has seriously bad optics" - Glover's opinion presented without counterpoint

**Lack of Clear Identification:**

The article is structured as news reporting with journalistic third-person framing in the opening paragraphs (lines 6-13), then shifts to publishing the full emails. This creates confusion:

1. The opening paragraphs present in news voice with editorial assertions mixed with attributed claims
2. The emails are clearly identified as the parties' own words
3. But the framing paragraphs contain unverified claims presented as established facts
4. No clear labeling indicates which portions are news reporting vs. commentary on a political dispute

**Factual Foundation Failures:**

Many claims lack proper factual foundation:

1. The 80% LGOIMA statistic - no source, timeframe, or verification
2. The 15% pay rise - no source documentation
3. "All time low" survey results - no citation or data
4. Auditor General guidance sections - cited but not quoted or verified
5. "Established policies and the Local Government Act" - cited but not specified or verified
6. Gladding's "allegations" - characterized but never presented

**Evidence:**

Opening paragraph: "Councillor Lisa Guy has accused Councillor Niki Gladding of making 'allegations that are both inaccurate and outside the standards of respectful governance' around the early, secretive recruitment of a replacement council CEO." (lines 6-8)
- "secretive" is characterization presented as fact
- Gladding's "allegations" are never specified, making "inaccurate" unverifiable
- Readers cannot assess the factual foundation of Guy's claim

"While saying 'everything is transparent' she urges Mr Glover to apply for documents under the Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act (LGOIMA)" (line 13)
- This appears to paraphrase rather than quote, and juxtaposes statements to imply contradiction
- The characterization may be editorial interpretation rather than fact

"It was this group that awarded Mr Theelen a 15% pay rise last year at the same time as the council's own community trust and satisfaction survey dropped to an all time low." (lines 11-12)
- Multiple factual claims (15%, "all time low") presented without source
- Temporal connection implies judgment/causation - this is comment not pure fact

"80% of complaints to the Chief Ombudsman have found QLDC to have wrongfully withheld LGOIMA information." (line 13)
- Statistical fact claim in editorial voice with no attribution or verification
- Readers cannot verify this or assess its accuracy

**Findings:**
The article breaches Principle 4 by failing to maintain clear distinction between factual information and opinion/characterization. The opening paragraphs present multiple claims as established facts that are actually disputed, unverified, or characterizations. The article mixes editorial assertions, attributed opinion, and factual claims without clear delineation. Critical statistics (80% LGOIMA, 15% pay rise, "all time low" survey) are presented as facts without sources. Characterizations ("secretive," "transparent") are presented as factual descriptions rather than disputed framings. The article should have clearly distinguished verified facts from the parties' competing characterizations, and should have labeled editorial context separately from factual reporting.

### Principle 6: Headlines and Captions
**Assessment:** Breach

**Analysis:**

The headline reads: "Lisa Guy: questions over CEO recruitment 'disrespectful and inaccurate.'"

**Accuracy Assessment:**
This headline is misleading in several ways:

1. **Ambiguous Attribution**: The headline structure makes it unclear what is "disrespectful and inaccurate":
   - It could mean: Guy says the questions are disrespectful and inaccurate (which is accurate)
   - It could mean: Guy's response to questions is disrespectful and inaccurate (which is not supported)
   - The ambiguity creates potential for reader confusion

2. **Incomplete Representation**: The headline focuses on Guy's dismissive characterization without conveying:
   - That this is about CEO recruitment during an election period
   - That both sides present substantive arguments about process and transparency
   - That Glover cites Auditor General guidance
   - That this involves competing claims about council transparency and LGOIMA

3. **Missing Key Element**: The headline omits the most newsworthy element: that CEO recruitment is proceeding in secret during an election period despite candidate objections. This is the public interest story, not the interpersonal dispute framing.

4. **Quote Selection**: By choosing to highlight Guy's dismissive characterization ("disrespectful and inaccurate"), the headline emphasizes personal conflict over substantive governance issues about:
   - Electoral timing
   - Transparency
   - Auditor General compliance
   - Council processes

**Misleading Elements:**

1. **Tone**: The headline's focus on "disrespectful and inaccurate" creates impression of personal squabble rather than serious governance dispute during election period

2. **Omissions**: The headline fails to convey:
   - Electoral context (Glover is mayoral candidate, election is Oct 11)
   - Substantive issue (CEO recruitment process and transparency)
   - Key controversy (recruitment proceeding secretly during election)
   - Auditor General guidance questions

3. **Balance**: The headline presents only Guy's dismissive framing, not the substantive concerns raised by Glover

**Substance Reflection:**

The headline captures one element of the article (Guy's characterization of questions as disrespectful/inaccurate) but fails to reflect:

1. The full Guy email explaining delegations and process
2. Glover's substantive response citing Auditor General guidance and arguing for pause
3. The broader context about QLDC transparency issues (LGOIMA compliance problems)
4. The electoral timing and implications
5. The missing voices (Mayor Lewers, Gladding, Cocks, Theelen)

A more accurate headline would be:
- "Guy defends CEO recruitment process as Glover calls for pause during election"
- "Council CEO recruitment process disputed during election campaign"
- "Mayoral candidate challenges 'secretive' CEO recruitment; Guy defends process"
- "Guy and Glover clash over CEO recruitment timing and transparency"

**Evidence:**

Current headline: "Lisa Guy: questions over CEO recruitment 'disrespectful and inaccurate.'" (line 2)

The colon structure creates ambiguity - does Guy say questions are disrespectful, or are Guy's statements disrespectful? The most natural reading is the former, but the headline structure allows misinterpretation.

The headline emphasizes Guy's dismissive characterization rather than the substantive governance issues at stake.

Article content shows the substance is about:
- CEO recruitment process during election (line 9: "early, secretive recruitment of a replacement council CEO")
- Competing claims about transparency and proper process (Guy: established policies; Glover: secretive and inappropriate timing)
- Auditor General guidance compliance (lines 57-58)
- LGOIMA transparency issues (line 13: "80% of complaints to the Chief Ombudsman have found QLDC to have wrongfully withheld LGOIMA information")

None of this substantive context appears in the headline.

**Findings:**
The headline breaches Principle 6 by failing to accurately and fairly convey the substance of the article. It reduces a complex governance dispute during an election period to a personal conflict characterized by one party's dismissive framing. The headline omits the key newsworthy elements (CEO recruitment during election, transparency concerns, Auditor General guidance, competing process claims) in favor of highlighting interpersonal friction ("disrespectful and inaccurate"). This misleads readers about the article's actual substance and public interest significance. The headline should have focused on the substantive governance and electoral issues rather than the personal characterizations.

---

### Principle 5: Columns, Blogs, Opinion and Letters
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**

**Identification as Opinion:**
The article is presented as news reporting with byline "by Peter Newport - Sep 22, 2025" (line 3). It is not labeled as opinion, column, or editorial content. The structure is news reporting format.

**Nature of Content:**
However, the bulk of the article (lines 22-65) consists of verbatim publication of correspondence between two parties. This is documentary evidence rather than opinion. The opening paragraphs (lines 6-21) provide context in news voice.

**Assessment:**
This article does not need to be labeled as opinion because it's not primarily opinion content - it's reporting on correspondence, albeit with problematic framing and lack of independent journalism. The issues with this article relate to insufficient reporting and verification (Principle 1) and failure to distinguish fact from characterization (Principle 4), not to mislabeling opinion as news.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 5. The article's problems stem from inadequate journalism rather than from being unlabeled opinion. It should be news reporting with better fact-checking and balance, not relabeled as opinion.

---

### Principle 10: Conflicts of Interest
**Assessment:** Potential Breach

**Analysis:**

**Electoral Context:**
This article is published during an election period (19 days before October 11 election) involving multiple electoral dynamics:

1. **John Glover's Candidacy**: Glover is identified as "mayoral candidate" (line 9), making this exchange part of his campaign platform challenging incumbent practices

2. **Unclear Electoral Status of Others**:
   - Lisa Guy: Not identified as candidate or non-candidate
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers: Not identified as seeking re-election or retiring
   - Councillor Cocks: Not mentioned as candidate
   - Niki Gladding: Referenced but electoral status not mentioned in this article

3. **Campaign Advantage**: By publishing Glover's detailed critique (including Auditor General guidance citations) without equivalent scrutiny or fact-checking, the article provides campaign platform for his mayoral bid

**Disclosure Requirements:**

The article should disclose:

1. **Complete Electoral Context**:
   - Which parties to this dispute are seeking election/re-election
   - That this controversy is part of the electoral campaign
   - How this fits into broader electoral narratives

2. **Relationship Context**:
   - How this correspondence was obtained (did Glover provide it to media as part of campaign?)
   - Whether Guy intended her response to be published
   - Whether this is part of coordinated campaign messaging

3. **Previous Coverage**:
   - The article references Gladding's "recent social-media opinions" (line 37) - has Crux covered those?
   - Is this part of ongoing coverage pattern?
   - Have other candidates been given similar platforms?

**Missing Context:**

1. **Guy's Electoral Status**: The article doesn't disclose whether Guy is seeking re-election, which is relevant to understanding her defense of incumbent processes

2. **Lewers' Electoral Status**: Mayor Lewers is central to this controversy but the article doesn't disclose whether he's seeking re-election as mayor (competing with Glover)

3. **Campaign Strategy**: The article doesn't acknowledge that Glover's detailed email (citing Auditor General guidance, calling for pause, criticizing "secretive" process) is likely part of his campaign platform against incumbent mayor

4. **Publication Intent**: Guy's note says she "appears not to have copied any media" (line 17) - this suggests Guy may not have intended publication. How did Crux obtain this? Through Glover? This should be disclosed.

**Evidence:**

"Both Niki Gladding and mayoral candidate John Glover have raised a number of questions" (line 9) - Glover is identified as "mayoral candidate" but this electoral context is not developed or applied to understanding the exchange.

"Unlike Mr Glover's email to all councillors, Councilor Guy appears not to have copied any media." (lines 17-18) - This suggests Glover intentionally provided his email to media (campaign strategy) while Guy did not. This should trigger disclosure of how Crux obtained the correspondence and whether Guy consented to publication.

"I note Councillor Gladding's recent social-media opinions and comments implying impropriety on my part" (line 37) - References prior public controversy that provides context, but article doesn't link to or explain Gladding's actual posts or electoral status.

The article provides substantial platform for Glover's campaign criticisms of incumbent mayor's process without disclosing:
- That this is part of mayoral campaign
- How the correspondence was obtained
- Whether other candidates received similar coverage
- What Lewers' response is (as incumbent mayor being challenged)

**Findings:**
Potential breach of Principle 10. While the article identifies Glover as "mayoral candidate," it fails to adequately disclose the full electoral context and how that context affects the story. Specifically: (1) it doesn't disclose whether Guy, Lewers, or others are seeking re-election; (2) it doesn't explain how private correspondence was obtained or whether Guy consented to publication; (3) it doesn't acknowledge this exchange is part of electoral campaign dynamics; (4) it provides campaign platform for challenger (Glover) without equivalent scrutiny or response from incumbent mayor (Lewers). The article should have disclosed the complete electoral context and explained how the correspondence was obtained, particularly given Guy appears not to have shared it with media herself.

---

### Principle 2: Privacy
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article discusses public officials (councillors, mayor, CEO) engaged in public business (CEO recruitment, governance processes) during an election period. All matters discussed are clearly in the public interest and public record domain.

The publication of the email exchange raises questions about intent and consent (covered under Principle 10) but not privacy per se, as the content relates entirely to public governance matters.

Guy's email signature noting "Sent from my I-Phone, On the move, On a Sunday" (line 41) is included, which could be seen as minor personal detail, but it was part of her sent email and doesn't constitute privacy breach.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 2.

---

### Principle 7: Discrimination and Diversity
**Assessment:** Compliant

**Analysis:**
The article does not raise issues related to gender, religion, minority groups, sexual orientation, age, race, color, or physical/mental disability. While it features a female councillor (Guy) and involves another female councillor (Gladding), gender is not emphasized or made relevant to the coverage.

**Findings:**
No breach of Principle 7.

---

### Other Relevant Principles

**Principle 3: Children and Young People**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

No children or young people are subjects of this article.

---

**Principle 8: Confidentiality**
**Assessment:** Compliant

The article does not rely on confidential sources. The emails are attributed to their authors (Guy and Glover). While questions exist about how private correspondence was obtained, this is a conflicts of interest issue (Principle 10) rather than confidentiality breach.

---

**Principle 9: Subterfuge**
**Assessment:** Compliant

There is no indication the article involved subterfuge, misrepresentation, or dishonest means of obtaining information. The article appears to publish correspondence provided by one of the parties (likely Glover).

---

**Principle 11: Photographs and Graphics**
**Assessment:** Not Applicable

The text provided does not include photographs or graphics details. Cannot assess from available information.

---

## Overall Assessment

**Summary of Breaches:**

1. **Principle 1 (Accuracy, Fairness and Balance) - BREACH**: The article fails to verify key factual claims (80% LGOIMA statistic, 15% pay rise, "all time low" survey, Auditor General guidance), fails to provide fair voice to key parties (Mayor Lewers, Gladding, Cocks, Theelen), and provides no independent reporting or fact-checking of competing claims. The article functions as stenography of a political dispute rather than journalism.

2. **Principle 4 (Comment and Fact) - BREACH**: The article fails to distinguish between verified facts and characterizations/opinions. Multiple claims are presented as facts without verification (LGOIMA statistics, pay rise amount, survey results). Characterizations like "secretive" are presented as factual descriptions rather than disputed framings.

3. **Principle 6 (Headlines and Captions) - BREACH**: The headline misleadingly focuses on personal conflict ("disrespectful and inaccurate") rather than substantive governance issues (CEO recruitment during election, transparency, Auditor General compliance). It omits key newsworthy elements and reduces complex governance dispute to interpersonal friction.

4. **Principle 10 (Conflicts of Interest) - POTENTIAL BREACH**: The article fails to adequately disclose electoral context (which parties are seeking election), how private correspondence was obtained, and that this exchange is part of electoral campaign dynamics. It provides campaign platform for challenger without equivalent scrutiny or response from incumbent mayor.

---

**Pattern Analysis:**

This article exhibits a concerning pattern of journalism abdication in favor of political stenography:

1. **Verification Failure**: The article makes no apparent effort to verify any factual claims made by either party:
   - 80% LGOIMA statistic - not verified
   - 15% pay rise - not verified
   - "All time low" survey - not verified
   - Auditor General guidance - not checked or quoted
   - Council delegation policies - not verified
   - Process compliance claims - not investigated

2. **Missing Voices**: The article publishes a dispute between Guy and Glover but fails to contact:
   - Mayor Lewers (central figure in recruitment process)
   - Niki Gladding (accused by Guy of "allegations that are both inaccurate")
   - Councillor Cocks (third member of recruitment committee)
   - CEO Mike Theelen (subject of recruitment, pay rise criticism)
   - Council Procurement Manager (led process per Guy)
   - Local government or governance experts
   - Office of the Auditor General (re: cited guidance)

3. **Context Gaps**: The article provides minimal context about:
   - Normal CEO recruitment processes
   - Whether election-period recruitment is common or problematic
   - QLDC's actual LGOIMA record
   - The pay rise decision-making
   - Gladding's actual "allegations"
   - Complete electoral stakes (who's running, who's not)

4. **Fact-Free Zone**: Beyond publishing the two emails verbatim, the article contributes almost no independent reporting, investigation, or verification. It's stenography, not journalism.

5. **Electoral Dynamics**: The article identifies Glover as "mayoral candidate" but fails to develop what this means: that he's challenging incumbent mayor Lewers, that this exchange is part of that challenge, that the CEO recruitment is an election issue, etc.

This pattern suggests Crux may be functioning more as a platform for political exchanges than as a news organization conducting independent journalism. If this pattern extends to other QLDC election coverage, it raises serious questions about the publication's role in informing democratic choice.

---

**Electoral Context:**

This article's publication during an election period has critical implications:

1. **Voter Information Needs**: Voters need verified facts about:
   - Whether CEO recruitment process is proper or improper
   - Whether it complies with Auditor General guidance
   - Whether the timing is appropriate or inappropriate
   - What QLDC's actual LGOIMA record is
   - Whether competing claims are accurate

   The article provides none of this - just competing campaign claims.

2. **Campaign Platform**: By publishing Glover's detailed critique (with Auditor General citations, process criticisms, calls for change) without verification or mayor's response, the article provides free campaign platform for his mayoral bid against incumbent mayor Lewers.

3. **Incomplete Electoral Context**: The article identifies Glover as candidate but doesn't identify:
   - Whether Guy is seeking re-election (relevant to her defense of process)
   - Whether Lewers is seeking re-election as mayor (critical context for understanding challenge)
   - Whether this is part of broader electoral narratives about QLDC transparency

   This incomplete context prevents voters from fully understanding the political dynamics.

4. **Substantive Issues Obscured**: The headline and framing emphasize personal conflict ("disrespectful and inaccurate") over substantive governance issues (recruitment timing, transparency, compliance). This disserves voters who need to understand substantive issues, not personality conflicts.

5. **Missing Accountability**: By not contacting Mayor Lewers for response to criticisms of his CEO recruitment process, the article denies voters the incumbent mayor's defense/explanation during an election where he may be seeking re-election (though article doesn't clarify).

The electoral context transforms what would already be inadequate journalism into a serious failure of democratic journalism. Voters deserve verified facts and comprehensive context, not unverified political claims presented as news.

## Recommendations

**For Formal Complaint:**

Based on this analysis, there are strong grounds for a formal complaint to NZMC citing the following principle breaches:

**Primary Complaints:**

1. **Principle 1 - Accuracy, Fairness and Balance**: The article fails to verify factual claims and omits essential voices. Specific grounds:
   - No verification of "80% of complaints to the Chief Ombudsman have found QLDC to have wrongfully withheld LGOIMA information"
   - No verification of "15% pay rise" or "all time low" community trust survey
   - No verification of Auditor General guidance cited by Glover or whether current process violates it
   - No comment sought from Mayor Lewers (central figure criticized by Glover)
   - No comment sought from Niki Gladding (accused by Guy of "inaccurate" allegations, but her allegations never presented)
   - No comment sought from Councillor Cocks, CEO Theelen, or Procurement Manager
   - No independent reporting on whether recruitment process is actually "secretive" or follows normal practice
   - No expert context on local government CEO recruitment practices

2. **Principle 4 - Comment and Fact**: The article fails to distinguish between verified facts and opinion/characterization. Specific grounds:
   - LGOIMA statistics presented as fact in editorial voice without source or verification
   - Pay rise and survey results presented as facts without verification
   - "Secretive" characterization presented as factual description rather than disputed framing
   - Paraphrased claims (Guy saying "everything is transparent") not clearly attributed
   - No clear distinction between what is verified fact vs. what are competing claims

3. **Principle 6 - Headlines and Captions**: The headline misleads about article substance. Specific grounds:
   - Headline focuses on "disrespectful and inaccurate" personal characterization
   - Omits substantive governance issues (CEO recruitment during election, transparency, Auditor General compliance)
   - Reduces complex governance dispute to interpersonal conflict
   - Fails to convey key newsworthy elements (electoral timing, process controversy, transparency concerns)

**Secondary Complaints:**

4. **Principle 10 - Conflicts of Interest**: The article inadequately discloses electoral context. Specific grounds:
   - Identifies Glover as "mayoral candidate" but doesn't develop electoral implications
   - Doesn't disclose whether Guy, Lewers, or Cocks are seeking (re-)election
   - Doesn't explain how private correspondence was obtained (Guy "appears not to have copied any media")
   - Provides campaign platform for Glover without mayor's response or equivalent scrutiny

---

**Key Evidence to Cite:**

1. **Unverified Statistical Claims:**
   - "80% of complaints to the Chief Ombudsman have found QLDC to have wrongfully withheld LGOIMA information." (line 13) - Presented as fact with no source, timeframe, or verification
   - "awarded Mr Theelen a 15% pay rise last year" (line 11) - Specific percentage with no source
   - "council's own community trust and satisfaction survey dropped to an all time low" (line 12) - Superlative claim with no citation or data

2. **Missing Essential Voices:**
   - Mayor Lewers: Not contacted despite being central figure in CEO recruitment criticized by Glover
   - Niki Gladding: Accused by Guy of "allegations that are both inaccurate and outside the standards of respectful governance" (line 7) but her allegations never presented and no right of reply given
   - Councillor Cocks: Third member of recruitment committee, no perspective provided
   - CEO Theelen: His position being recruited for, his pay criticized - no comment
   - No expert voices on local government recruitment practices

3. **Fact vs. Characterization Confusion:**
   - "early, secretive recruitment" (line 9) - Characterization presented as factual description
   - "While saying 'everything is transparent' she urges Mr Glover to apply for documents under LGOIMA" (line 13) - Appears to be paraphrase creating implied contradiction, not clearly attributed as quote or characterization
   - Opening paragraph presents "secretive" as fact rather than as Glover's contested characterization

4. **No Independent Verification:**
   - Glover cites Auditor General guidance sections 5.14-5.16, 5.21, 5.22, 5.34 (lines 57-58) - not verified or quoted
   - Guy claims process follows "QLDC's established policies and the Local Government Act" (line 24) - not verified
   - Competing claims about transparency and proper process - no independent assessment of which is accurate

5. **Misleading Headline:**
   - "Lisa Guy: questions over CEO recruitment 'disrespectful and inaccurate.'" (line 2) - Focuses on personal conflict rather than substantive governance issues
   - Omits key newsworthy elements: electoral timing, transparency controversy, Auditor General compliance questions, "secretive" process allegations

6. **Incomplete Electoral Disclosure:**
   - "mayoral candidate John Glover" (line 9) - Electoral status identified but not developed
   - No disclosure whether Guy, Lewers, or Cocks seeking (re-)election
   - "Unlike Mr Glover's email to all councillors, Councilor Guy appears not to have copied any media." (lines 17-18) - Suggests Glover provided to media as campaign strategy, but not explored

**Remedies to Request:**

From NZMC, if complaint is upheld:

1. **Adverse Ruling Publication**: Crux must publish NZMC's summary of the decision with fair prominence in the section where original article ran

2. **Online Correction**: The enduring electronic copy must carry note at top that it was found in breach and why, with link to full NZMC ruling

3. **Corrections Required**: Request correction acknowledging:
   - Statistical claims were not verified (LGOIMA 80%, pay rise 15%, survey results)
   - Key voices were omitted (Mayor Lewers, Niki Gladding, Councillor Cocks, CEO Theelen)
   - Characterizations ("secretive") were presented as facts rather than disputed framings
   - Electoral context was inadequately disclosed
   - Headline misrepresented article substance

4. **Follow-up Reporting**: Request follow-up article that:
   - Seeks comment from all omitted parties
   - Verifies or corrects statistical claims
   - Independently assesses whether recruitment process complies with Auditor General guidance
   - Provides complete electoral context
   - Distinguishes verified facts from competing claims

5. **Right of Reply**: Request NZMC direct right of reply for:
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers (to respond to Glover's criticisms of recruitment process)
   - Niki Gladding (to respond to Guy's characterization of her "allegations" as "inaccurate")
   - CEO Mike Theelen (to respond to criticism of pay rise and recruitment timing)

   To be given fair prominence similar to original article

6. **Process Improvements**: Request Crux establish clear editorial policies for:
   - Mandatory verification of statistical claims before publication
   - Mandatory contact attempts for all parties criticized or centrally involved in disputes
   - Clear labeling of verified facts vs. unverified claims
   - Electoral coverage disclosure requirements
   - Independent reporting standards (not just publishing competing claims)

---

**Additional Strategic Considerations:**

1. **Timing**: The one-month deadline for complaining to publisher is October 22, 2025. The complaint should be made promptly to allow time for escalation to NZMC if necessary before electoral impact is complete.

2. **Public Interest**: This complaint serves public interest by:
   - Ensuring electoral journalism meets basic accuracy and verification standards
   - Protecting public officials' right to fair coverage and response
   - Demanding independent fact-checking rather than political stenography
   - Requiring disclosure of electoral context so voters understand political dynamics
   - Establishing that "he said/she said" journalism is insufficient during elections

3. **Standing**: Consider who should bring complaint:
   - Mayor Glyn Lewers (criticized by Glover, not given opportunity to respond)
   - Niki Gladding (accused by Guy of "inaccurate" allegations, allegations not specified, no right of reply)
   - CEO Mike Theelen (pay criticized, recruitment challenged, no comment sought)
   - Community member concerned about electoral journalism standards
   - NZMC will consider third-party complaints but may require consent from affected individuals

4. **Pattern Evidence**: If pursuing complaint, investigate whether:
   - Crux has pattern of publishing political correspondence without verification
   - Other articles show similar absence of fact-checking
   - This is part of broader pattern of stenography over journalism
   - Electoral coverage generally lacks independent reporting and verification

5. **Key Principle**: This complaint centers on the principle that journalism requires verification and independent reporting, not just publishing competing claims. During an election, this principle is even more critical as voters need verified facts, not unverified campaign messaging.

6. **Broader Impact**: This complaint could establish important precedents about:
   - Obligation to verify factual claims even when quoting sources
   - Obligation to contact parties criticized or centrally involved
   - Standards for electoral journalism (context disclosure, verification, independence)
   - Insufficiency of "both sides" stenography without fact-checking
   - Headline accuracy requirements (substance over sensation)

**Key Principles Applied in This Review:**

1. **Evidence-Based**: All breach findings cite specific passages from article
2. **Proportionate**: Distinguishes between clear breaches, potential breaches, and compliant content
3. **Contextual**: Considers electoral timing and public interest implications
4. **Practical**: Provides actionable recommendations for complaint process
5. **Standards-Focused**: Emphasizes journalism's verification and independence obligations

---

**Conclusion:**

This article represents a significant failure of basic journalistic standards. The article publishes competing political claims during an election period but makes no apparent effort to verify any factual assertions, contact any omitted but essential parties, or provide independent reporting on the substantive issues at stake.

The article's primary failures are:
1. **No verification** of multiple serious factual claims (LGOIMA statistics, pay rise amount, survey results, Auditor General guidance compliance)
2. **No contact** with essential parties (Mayor Lewers, Niki Gladding, Councillor Cocks, CEO Theelen, experts)
3. **No independent reporting** on whether recruitment process is proper or improper, transparent or secretive, compliant or non-compliant
4. **Misleading headline** emphasizing personal conflict over substantive governance issues
5. **Inadequate electoral context** disclosure (who's running, what's at stake, campaign dynamics)

The result is stenography, not journalism. During an election period when voters need verified facts and comprehensive context to make informed democratic choices, the article provides only unverified competing claims presented as news.

A formal complaint is warranted to establish that journalism requires verification and independent reporting, not just publication of political exchanges. The complaint serves not only to address this specific article but to uphold basic standards for electoral journalism that serve democratic integrity and informed voter choice.
